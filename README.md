# M-Gemini ♊️

**M-Gemini** is an automated archival engine and secure knowledge base designed to capture, redact, and organize the "thought process" and execution history of the Gemini CLI agent.

Built with a **Security-First** philosophy, it transforms raw machine-readable logs into a structured, human-readable repository while ensuring that sensitive data never touches the Git history.

### 🛡️ STRICT Security Architecture
*   **3-Layer Redaction:** Automated PII and secret stripping during the synchronization process.
*   **Gitleaks-Lite:** Local pre-commit hooks that block the accidental inclusion of API keys, tokens (including YubiKey OTPs), and credentials.
*   **Audit Logging:** Integrated system security auditing and continuous monitoring via `auditd`.
*   **Integrity:** Enforcement of GPG commit signing for verified authenticity.

### 📖 Human-Centric Archival
*   **Automated Journaling:** Generates daily summaries of collaborative accomplishments.
*   **Markdown Transformation:** Converts complex JSON/Protobuf sessions into clean, searchable Markdown.
*   **Chronological Discovery:** Easy navigation through the evolution of project tasks and system configurations.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **`FULL_CHAT_LOG.md`**
  A single, chronologically ordered master chat log of all recorded sessions.

- **`chat_logs/`**
  Raw JSON logs synchronized from the local Gemini temporary directory. These are redacted versions of the original logs.

- **`chat_logs_markdown/`**
  Individual Markdown files for each session, converted from the JSON chat logs.
  - Includes tool calls, arguments, and outputs.
  - Metadata such as timestamps and user roles.

- **`journals/`**
  Daily entries summarizing key utilities and milestones accomplished.

- **`antigravity-data/`**
  Raw Protocol Buffer (`.pb`) files synced from local storage.

- **`scripts/`**
  - `sync_raw_logs.py`: Syncs and redacts logs from the local filesystem to this repository.
  - `convert_to_markdown.py`: Processes raw JSON logs and generates beautiful Markdown files.
  - `combine_chat_logs.py`: Aggregates sessions into the master `FULL_CHAT_LOG.md`.
  - `generate_journals.py`: Creates daily chronological summaries in the `journals/` folder.
  - `pre_commit_check.py`: The STRICT security enforcement engine.

- **`docs/`**
  - `M-SECURITY.md`: Comprehensive system security audit and hardening guide.
  - `SECURITY.md`: Core security policies and redaction details.

## 🚀 Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Access to local Gemini CLI log files (typically in `~/.gemini/tmp/...`)

### Operations Workflow

1. **Sync and Redact:**
   Bring in the latest logs from your local system:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/sync_raw_logs.py
   ```

2. **Generate Documentation:**
   Convert logs to Markdown and update journals:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/convert_to_markdown.py
   python3 scripts/generate_journals.py
   ```

3. **Consolidate History:**
   Regenerate the master chat log:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/combine_chat_logs.py
   ```

## 🔒 Security enforcement

This repository implements automated redaction to protect sensitive information.
- **PII Redaction:** Email addresses and specific personal identifiers are automatically masked.
- **Secret Redaction:** Patterns matching API keys, tokens (GitHub, Slack, etc.), YubiKey OTPs, and Private Keys are replaced with placeholders.
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** The repository is configured to reject commits containing specific high-sensitivity strings.

## ℹ️ About Gemini CLI

Gemini CLI is an interactive command-line agent capable of performing software engineering tasks, system administration, and general assistance directly within the terminal. This archive captures the "thought process" and execution steps of the agent.
