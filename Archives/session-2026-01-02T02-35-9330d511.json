I am unable to run 'run_shell_command' as it returns 'Command rejected because it could not be parsed safely' for every command I try (whoami, dir, hostname, Get-Process). Please investigate why this is happening and if you can, provide the output of 'whoami'. If you also cannot run shell commands, please confirm. I have already found that the user is likely 'LEGION\\Mischa' from logs and SSH keys, but I need to know why the shell tool is failing.\n</objective>"
