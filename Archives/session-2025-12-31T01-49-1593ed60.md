👤: **fix hung/stalled cosmic-store app**

> 🧠 **Assessing Cosmic-Store Issues**
> I'm focused on troubleshooting a stalled `cosmic-store` application. My immediate goal is to ascertain whether any processes are currently running for this app. If I find them, I'll proceed with termination as a likely solution.

> 🧠 **Enumerating Process Steps**
> I'm now formulating a plan. I will begin by enumerating processes that match `cosmic-store`. I'll present the user with details, then seek confirmation before attempting to kill any found processes. If nothing is running, I'll provide appropriate feedback.

> 🛠️ **Ran `pgrep`**
> ` pgrep -af cosmic-store `
> -> *130096 cosmic-store 134510 [cosmic-store] <defunct> 134602 [cosmic-store] <defunct> 149597 cosmic-store 166805 bash -c shopt -u promptvars nullglob extglob nocaseglob dotglob; { pgrep -af cosmic-store...*

🤖: I will search for any running `cosmic-store` processes.


> 🧠 **Investigating Process States**
> I'm currently observing several `cosmic-store` processes. I see active instances running under PIDs 130096 and 149597. There are also two defunct (zombie) processes, under PIDs 134510 and 134602. It seems like the defunct ones will resolve themselves. I need to consider killing the active processes to resolve the problem.

> 🧠 **Analyzing Application State**
> I've decided to proceed directly to the fix. Since the user wants a stalled app unstuck, and killing the active processes seems like the immediate solution. I will attempt a graceful termination (SIGTERM) of the active processes, as that's the preferred method. I'll inform the user of this action.

> 🛠️ **Ran `kill`**
> ` kill 130096 149597 `

🤖: I found two active `cosmic-store` processes (PIDs 130096 and 149597) and a couple of defunct ones. I will attempt to terminate the active processes to resolve the stall.


> 🧠 **Assessing Command Execution**
> I've confirmed the `kill` command's success; a SIGTERM was sent. Now, I must confirm process termination. I plan to use `pgrep` to check for lingering processes, as some may not respond to the signal. This step is crucial to ensure the intended outcome.

> 🛠️ **Ran `pgrep`**
> ` pgrep -af cosmic-store `
> -> *166828 bash -c shopt -u promptvars nullglob extglob nocaseglob dotglob; { pgrep -af cosmic-store; }; __code=$?; pgrep -g 0 >/tmp/shell_pgrep_41f176a7e03c.tmp 2>&1; exit $__code;*

🤖: I have sent a termination signal to the processes. I will now verify if they have successfully closed.


> 🧠 **Announcing App Termination**
> I'm pleased to report that the `pgrep` command no longer flags `cosmic-store` processes. This crucial indicator confirms the processes have ceased operations. I'm ready to relay the successful shutdown to the user.

🤖: The `cosmic-store` processes have been successfully terminated. You should be able to restart the application now.
