Flip event timeout on head 0`. This means the GPU failed to update the screen frame in time.\n    *   At `10:11:05`, `cosmic-comp` failed to render entirely: `Failed to submit rendering ... Page flip commit failed ... (Device or resource busy)`.\n4.  **Synchronization Errors:** Later logs (`10:12:59`) show NVIDIA driver synchronization errors (`NVRM: GPU0 _semsurfAddWaiter`), indicating persistent communication issues between the driver and the hardware/compositor.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe \"glitching\" is caused by the NVIDIA driver failing to properly resume and synchronize with the COSMIC compositor (`cosmic-comp`), leading to frame flip timeouts and rendering failures. The panel itself is likely a victim of the compositor's inability to update the display.\n\nI have saved these details to your memory for future reference.",

Once we fix the driver behavior, the panel should resume correctly on its own. If issues persist after this fix, we can look into an automated restart script as a fallback.\n\n**Action Plan:**\nI will update `/boot/refind_linux.conf` to include the missing parameter. This requires `sudo` privileges.\n\n**Current Config:**\n```text\n\"Boot using default options\"   \"root=UUID=... rw ... nvidia-drm.modeset=1 quiet ...\"\n```\n\n**New Config:**\n```text\n\"Boot using default options\"   \"root=UUID=... rw ... nvidia-drm.modeset=1 nvidia.NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations=1 quiet ...\"\n```\n\nYou will need to **reboot** after this change for it to take effect.\n\nShall I proceed with editing the file?",

I'm searching the `Preferences` file to see if the URL is associated with this ID, and what else is present. The goal is to confirm whether or not this is tied to the Gemini app and then find its location. Then, I can advise the user on removing the app using `helium://apps`.",

Open **Helium**.\n2.  Type `chrome://apps` (or `helium://apps`) in the address bar and press Enter.\n3.  Look for the **Gemini** icon in the grid of installed apps.\n4.  **Right-click** the icon and select **\"Remove from Helium\"** (or \"Uninstall\").\n5.  Navigate back to [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com).\n6.  The install option (usually an icon in the address bar or \"Install Gemini\" in the menu) should now appear.",
