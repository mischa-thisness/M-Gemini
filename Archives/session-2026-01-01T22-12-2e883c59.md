👤: **install github desktop and auth it with current gh**

> 🧠 **Assessing Environment Setup**
> I've confirmed the operating system is Windows (win32). I'm currently within the system32 directory, which isn't ideal for installation. It's time to relocate and prepare for GitHub Desktop setup with `gh` authentication.

> 🧠 **Moving to Workspace & Checking Tools**
> I'm now in the user's temporary directory, ready to download installers if necessary. I'm focusing on verifying the presence of `winget`, Windows' package manager. Simultaneously, I'm checking if the `gh` CLI is installed and authenticated as per the user's instruction. My goal is to streamline the GitHub Desktop installation process using these tools if available, and if `gh` is authenticated, I'll figure out how to leverage that.

> 🧠 **Refining Auth Strategy**
> I'm now thinking through authentication for GitHub Desktop. It seems `gh` might be the key. I need to figure out how to leverage `gh`'s existing authentication for GitHub Desktop's use. I will first install GitHub Desktop, then check if `gh` is installed and authenticated. Afterwards, I will explore the possibility of configuring git to use the credentials held by `gh`. I'm unsure of any CLI command to inject the auth from `gh` into GitHub Desktop's GUI without user input, given that they are completely different in nature.

> 🧠 **Evaluating Credential Integration**
> I'm now contemplating how to integrate `gh`'s credential helper with GitHub Desktop, exploring ways to avoid redundant authentication steps. I recall there's a Windows Credential Manager and that `gh` leverages its own credential helper. My plan is to install GitHub Desktop first, then investigate how to make it utilize the existing credentials from `gh`.

> 🛠️ **Ran `winget`**
> ` winget --version; gh --version `
> -> *v1.12.350 gh version 2.83.2 (2025-12-10) https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/tag/v2.83.2*


> 🧠 **Investigating Installation Workflow**
> I've got `winget` and `gh` set up. Now, I'm using `winget` to install GitHub Desktop. Once that's done, I'll check my `gh` authentication status to see who is currently logged in. I'm focusing on that "auth it" step next; it seems there isn't a simple way to directly push auth from `gh` to GitHub Desktop.

> 🧠 **Assessing Auth Integration**
> Okay, so I've installed GitHub Desktop. My next move is to check if it's already set up to use `gh` as a credential helper. I'm thinking about how the standard browser-based login of GitHub Desktop might clash with the `gh` authentication scheme. I'm exploring if there's a seamless way to leverage `gh`'s capabilities within the context of GitHub Desktop's workflow.

> 🧠 **Integrating Authentication Methods**
> I've successfully installed GitHub Desktop and authenticated `gh` using SSH, which makes for a good start. I'm now exploring how to smoothly integrate the authentication methods used by the GUI and the CLI tools, as they currently operate independently, which is cumbersome and less streamlined. The user experience can surely be improved here.

> 🧠 **Streamlining Credential Handling**
> I've been examining the discrepancies between `gh` and GitHub Desktop's authentication approaches. My thinking now is that I can't directly automate the GitHub Desktop login via the UI since I can't click GUI buttons. However, I can ensure `gh` is set as the global git credential helper. This offers a bridge, potentially allowing GitHub Desktop to leverage `gh`'s token if it respects the global git config, assuming it falls back to the git credential helper. I'll need to check if `gh` is already configured before making any changes.

> 🛠️ **Ran `git`**
> ` git config --global credential.helper `
> -> *Command exited with code: 1*


> 🧠 **Investigating Git Credentials**
> I've discovered the `credential.helper` is not globally configured, as the command returned an exit code of 1 or no output. My new focus involves setting `gh` as the Git credential helper. This should permit git operations on this machine to use `gh` credentials for authorization. I plan to use `gh auth setup-git` to implement this. I'm keen on establishing seamless interaction with GitHub.

> 🧠 **Confirming GitHub Desktop Auth**
> I've set up `gh` as the Git credential helper to ensure standard Git commands use my GitHub credentials. I've also verified that GitHub Desktop is installed.  I will highlight a key distinction:  `gh` authenticates Git operations within the CLI but I'll need to sign into GitHub Desktop directly for its full features, since it uses a separate token management system. This ensures that the user is aware of the differing scope of authentication.

> 🧠 **Establishing Git Identity**
> I've successfully set up GitHub Desktop, enabling it to utilize the `gh` CLI credentials for `git`.  This configuration streamlines authentication.

> 🧠 **Verifying Configuration Changes**
> I'm now in the process of verifying that the `git` configuration accurately reflects the changes I've made. Specifically, I'm checking that the global credential helper is indeed using the authenticated `gh` session. Interestingly, I've observed that the `gh auth status` command reports "ssh" as the Git operations protocol. This indicates that while the credential helper is set up for HTTPS, the command-line is using SSH. GitHub Desktop has its own handling of SSH keys.

> 🛠️ **Ran `git`**
> ` git config --global credential.helper `
> -> *Command exited with code: 1*


> 🧠 **Verifying Configuration Setup**
> I was surprised. `gh auth setup-git` apparently completed successfully, yet `git config --global credential.helper` is still failing. Could it be that `gh` only configured credentials for the current host?  My expectation was that it would set: `git config --global credential.https://github.com`.

> 🧠 **Investigating Git Credentials**
> I'm now investigating the specific Git configuration. I've found an empty credential helper setting and a specific GitHub credential helper command, which appears correct. This seems to confirm my hypothesis that the setup did not apply globally. I will check the config list to look for a credential helper entry.

> 🛠️ **Ran `git`**
> ` git config --global --list `
> -> *credential.https://github.com.helper= credential.https://github.com.helper=!'C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe' auth git-credential credential.https://gist.github.com.helper= credential.https://gist....*


> 🧠 **Validating Configuration Success**
> I've confirmed that the configuration focuses on `https://github.com` specifically, not a broad `credential.helper` scope. This targeted approach is sounder from a security standpoint. Effectively, `gh` auth is now bridged for git operations. My work is complete. I'm reporting the positive outcome now.

🤖: GitHub Desktop has been successfully installed.

I have also executed `gh auth setup-git` to configure Git to use your GitHub CLI credentials for `https://github.com` operations.

**Note:** GitHub Desktop is a GUI application with its own separate login session. While the underlying `git` commands may now respect your CLI credentials, you will still need to open GitHub Desktop and select **"File" > "Options" > "Accounts"** (or follow the welcome prompt) to sign in for full UI functionality.
