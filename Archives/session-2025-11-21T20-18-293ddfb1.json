To test if it's working, press `Windows + R`, type `microsoft-edge:https://google.com`, and press Enter. Your default browser should open the URL.[1][2][4]\n\nIf you encounter issues, re-run the installer as Administrator, or switch to Service Mode if needed.[1]\n\nSources:\n[1] windowsforum.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHfQeIu12VF328tj960NgyqWa8Ymd9W_rXgEYKNWA8n37SYiynO1976oNB0jIic72FHqfQONbLLmk7uoZwYo57JbMegZ8TIijobL7NXOQV0mA1SGT427L-0FLmKjRnhWAg_2_6yxFb1NMeXWVhqLQeTsXe6NTTmhU5Q5oVIXjQZbnZACdJE_6OoeFWCXIAYJjpnrAGHQP-3nJ7p)\n[2] howtogeek.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG4kHZUOR5yWkg5XgNn5dZW-Om0EnvQuCYw17or0DqGXZ6yhBYqBXnFcp0qUXouq_8QMWMKF2iRIFacffC_CwRe4AkCg13TmgFldqg97dD71CROEE19vRAegqsxsW5yYgd6SYYsD82rGgBQrNHNjhxQ_Vv9WCYCOyHVdQluvv_iE3i9KKQuL2Pc8D6owdfhLkQOOSGWuhqF)\n[3] updatestar.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGPQ6eB9dbCy-ujNRSnmGY7QlfrtNB0i8r7EUdi63o_lbeYTTmjXy5xeikOaIe0kKncbBdN77nQ1RKTuxhiyWlUH9287ethWBCffMRdb2HPO07zlQV1GKsuEu_DSlFR6nR8)\n[4] github.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG9jsfZ9AWWHHSij9YJV3r-ucVHo7JslFwTfaSGA0NYf7md_cKge_6ycJp1TKekWUw-XGwVJ-7qBo8I5BrPQveRY9rcGt2ypNQYkssZ0LzY9TvwosNnxw-NV7CU2SpC6rDnzAiG)\n[5] winstall.app (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHXwh1CGO1qEzbDB0QaRD0E6_3I8MjhxT2PIKD7KNm7UziXBcDD990HeFRlZbv7I_00dPRpja6QyKd0-XkDMbPmeMlZO4RbtprJK3AkEsBkVktpczFc0mzIdPZXTYDnU_UMfi4fkiyjTPsU4g==)"

Click \"Next\"[5].\n5.  **Select additional tasks (optional):** You can choose to create a desktop icon or add VS Code to your `PATH` environment variable (which allows you to open VS Code from the command line by typing `code .`). It's recommended to keep the `PATH` option enabled[1][3]. Click \"Next\"[3].\n6.  **Install:** Click \"Install\" to begin the installation[5][3].\n7.  **Finish:** Once the installation is complete, you can choose to launch Visual Studio Code immediately by checking the \"Launch Visual Studio Code\" box and clicking \"Finish\"[5][3].\n\nAfter installation, you might need to restart your console for the `code .` command to work if you chose to add it to your `PATH`[1].\n\nSources:\n[1] visualstudio.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHs0jeisClI2HduWSwbyD8sQVHSksG_x8Iz1yU8nJfqA1FaKCvFi54vzCCr07_IjaK7cr72-3JH6Xgm1KTmlCJchvSXv3uNkiMECKNG9XPyo5flvvJXsWapU35qMH0t6X96dkg-699Yf3KFvw==)\n[2] visualstudio.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHs4xGnqKQ03ESGQqxZNLWcrjpYz4jT3QRFV244i9HRQBTq3NiOmJmfJz2lgC2oAzpuF58tXEkEcZ5L784LLLMS_DxiUjd2AJ-Hs3wBjY6fLPk7aiNnOg2KjQ==)\n[3] youtube.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE1esMHwrpn6IWVmH1FtoBC1IxPa74SgqaLwyXQhRiWH4o_1GaG8V8sbe6jecv7uUAVdatwvG6QY60fNTkBTwNVhP_5jzrmxV-69W_dE2qEFuLvObnkoS9NIH2_fMCSLzQEz_2UrXI=)\n[4] microsoft.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF1MAsFFaUoep70y1Hc68RhTZqoe0U-HnKmmUG9Kyt2bCTe07_avlEQUCjzhE4xNidgZlMFMvD4he3I69fs9fcZcXsTnGOdLQfu39H9fo21csMBhb7OqRLCwyF0wVYud_VZBs7rREdtZQ==)\n[5] geeksforgeeks.org (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGI2qk3_tmhW3jgm1uBYHERlG4XP80qPWPPNDYKvalD2PJaJPYfNgvxAQRPTyhZa_ka_qzU0kSC4FHZ77deIWkU9r_hXof3iYKXNdyr1mmlgaMB2yXstQ6ewm4zbisi4X1wDaoXDesAZFtmb_NppHco6ZxQtwSNFIMY0DcBw4OcpqqHHiedwDzRFMLN2YG6ib_RUIW7FxU10jA=)"
