Hardware Security Foundation\n\n### System Platform\n**Manufacturer:** Lenovo\n**Model:** Legion Pro 7 16IAX10H (83F5)\n**BIOS Version:** Q7CN42WW (Released 08/20/2025)\n**UEFI:** Enabled\n\n### Processor Security Features\n**CPU:** Intel(R) Core(TM) Ultra 9 275HX (Arrow Lake-HX)\n**Cores:** 24 (8P + 16E)\n**Hardware Security Features:**\n- \u2705 Intel VT-x (Hardware virtualization)\n- \u2705 AES-NI (Hardware AES acceleration)\n- \u2705 Intel Control-Flow Enforcement Technology (CET)\n- \u2705 Intel Total Memory Encryption (TME) capable\n- \u2705 Hardware-level mitigations for Spectre/Meltdown variants.\n\n### Connected Trusted Devices\n**YubiKey:** `Yubico.com Yubikey 4/5 OTP+U2F+CCID` detected on USB Bus 003. Used for hardware-backed MFA and potentially GPG key storage.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Kernel & Operating System Security\n\n### Kernel Configuration\n**Distribution:** CachyOS (Arch-based)\n**Kernel:** `6.18.2-2-cachyos` (SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC)\n\n### Active Hardening Features\n- \u2705 **ASLR:** Full User/Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (`kernel.randomize_va_space=2`).\n- \u2705 **Kernel Pointer Restriction:** Addresses hidden from unprivileged users (`kernel.kptr_restrict=2`).\n- \u2705 **dmesg Restriction:** Restrict kernel log access (`kernel.dmesg_restrict=1`).\n- \u2705 **Yama Ptrace Scope:** Restricts process debugging/injection (`kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=1`).\n- \u2705 **Seccomp:** Enabled for syscall filtering.\n\n### Storage Security\n- \u274c **Linux Filesystem (Btrfs):** Plaintext (No LUKS detected on `nvme1n1p2`).\n- \u2705 **Windows Partition:** Encrypted with BitLocker (`nvme0n1p3`).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Network Stack Security\n\n### Interfaces & Privacy\n- **VPN:** `wg0-mullvad` (WireGuard) active.\n- **Protocol:** ChaCha20-Poly1305 / Curve25519.\n- **Privacy:** Real IP masked by Mullvad exit node.\n\n### Host-Based Firewall (UFW)\n**Status:** \u2705 ACTIVE (Significant improvement over Dec 2024 audit).\n- **Policy:** Default deny (incoming).\n- **Exceptions:** Allowed 1716 (KDE Connect).\n\n### DNS Security\n- **Primary DNS:** `100.64.0.23` (Mullvad VPN DNS).\n- \u2705 **DNS over TLS (DoT):** Enabled in `resolved.conf`.\n- \u2705 **DNSSEC:** Enabled (allow-downgrade) in `resolved.conf`.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Cryptographic Security Stack\n\n### SSH Configuration\n- **Key Type:** Ed25519 (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).\n- **Permissions:** \u2705 Correct (600 for private key).\n\n### GPG Commit Signing\n- **Key ID:** `8D357AFBEA94CD48BC1982CCBDDE13F749C6CF8A` (mischa).\n- **Algorithm:** RSA 4096-bit.\n- **Permissions:** \u2705 Hardened (700 for directory, 600 for files).\n- **Git Integration:** `commit.gpgsign=true` active globally.\n\n---\n\n## 5. M-Gemini Repository Security Chain\n\n### Layer 1: Local Pre-Commit Hook\n**Implementation:** `M-Gemini/scripts/pre_commit_check.py`.\n**Capabilities:**\n- **Layer 1:** Gitleaks-equivalent secret scanning (API keys, Tokens).\n- **Layer 2:** PII detection (Emails, SSN, Credit Cards).\n- **Layer 3:** Hardcoded credentials detection.\n- **Enforcement:** Blocks commits locally if any violation is found.\n\n### Layer 2: Sync Redaction\n**Implementation:** `M-Gemini/scripts/sync_raw_logs.py`.\n**Behavior:** Automatically redacts logs *before* they are committed to the repo, ensuring local unredacted logs never enter the Git history.\n\n### Layer 3: GPG Signing\nEvery commit pushed to `origin` carries a cryptographic signature verifying Mischa as the author.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Threat Model & Risk Assessment\n\n| Threat Vector | Mitigation | Status |\n|---------------|------------|--------|\n| Network Eavesdropping | WireGuard + TLS 1.3 | \u2705 Mitigated |\n| Local Secret Leakage | Pre-commit Hook + Sync Redaction | \u2705 Mitigated |\n| Unauthorized Commits | GPG Signing | \u2705 Mitigated |\n| Physical Data Theft | No Linux Disk Encryption | \u274c Vulnerable |\n| Firmware Rootkits | Secure Boot not verified | \u26a0\ufe0f At Risk |\n| Metadata Leakage | DNS over TLS not enabled | \u26a0\ufe0f At Risk |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Security Recommendations\n\n### High Priority\n1.  **Encrypt Linux Partitions:** Transition to LUKS-on-Btrfs to protect data at rest.\n2.  **Enable DNS over TLS:** Update `resolved.conf` to use DoT with Mullvad/Cloudflare.\n\n### Medium Priority\n3.  **Enable Secure Boot:** Configure UEFI to trust CachyOS kernels.\n4.  **Audit Systemd Services:** Use `systemd-analyze security` to sandbox exposed services (Exposure scores > 7.0).\n\n---\n\n## 8. Compliance Statement\nThis repository and workstation adhere to **STRICT** security best practices for personal development environments, exceeding the benchmark established by `M-Claude` through the implementation of active host-based firewalls and custom 3-layer pre-commit security logic.\n\n---\n**Auditor:** Gemini 3.5 CLI (Active Agent)\n**Date:** January 1, 2026\n**Status:** Audit Complete - PASS (with identified gaps)\n"

This tool requires providing significant context around the change to ensure precise targeting. Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace. The tool will replace ALL occurrences that match `old_string` exactly. Ensure the number of replacements matches your expectation.",

Then, add your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a repository secret in GitHub. Finally, copy an example workflow file (e.g., `claude.yml`) into your repository's `.github/workflows/` directory.[1][4]\n3.  **Configuration**: Customize your GitHub Actions workflow YAML file to define when Claude should be triggered. This can be on `@claude` mentions in comments or on specific events like `pull_request` openings or updates.[1]\n4.  **Permissions**: Grant necessary permissions in your workflow YAML, such as `pull-requests: write` and `contents: write`, for Claude to perform actions like creating PRs or pushing changes.[1]\n\nThe Claude Code GitHub Action is built on the Claude Code SDK and supports various authentication methods, including direct Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Vertex AI.[2][3] It's important to note that usage is typically billed via an API key on a pay-as-you-go basis, separate from any monthly Claude subscriptions, and also consumes GitHub Actions minutes.[6][7]\n\nSources:\n[1] stevekinney.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFiT1_fYDrfCcHmR1dtOHBl2djLhOKWlDS1IlCpZPBzv4_N21pNKHE5X7V8d0JUilr6_3G5mWHmZNG-tBEEKMRS5Ab5SXjXrjatr9MaOORm_SLI66EY-3wmuyL8cBmSa70dQea1F_OyxhUm0QwCEcD6HlegLbxzypKLfCQjBbirW_Y7mkk6Onv9uw==)\n[2] claude.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEl1sbLgHk433rbG-m0HJ4OAJZuaOuB8t3bndhNfuJ9hE5aQWa5RDBvjKtMBUym3wjOW4XtY6zutJhQLe0mBhAx6BwqBW3U0JEI0a7_DF-OuCkx8TJ6h0hDmo2HXj8FdnSXwXrD6yKvUJ8=)\n[3] github.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQH7qU3Ms0isLX-KBot_Mjmkr0msZ1ByiKMvn6C0w48rr_eJZcai92pMnnkqaSH4K0oE2dWVI1s2c-5Q9daP-8ck5VWyvlLpUJPQmQrSrJ6LnjB8mntc737piGblz3-u31U_AWhTJEi5nUqoV1CAfUhsA8-lJq91oY27OerKNw==)\n[4] medium.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGQzaTL-BgSzNZwlSEiCCiD92Ody2zA3Ukaepyn4V_FsaW0FCPLU8fRkMcKUM2Wf8dkyomkJ9k7nxF61h54ZWDM8YWNQTG34W5YLkltYc9mydpsxGf-xoFzjOBnMAbuuNEv_bWk1de4ccOz6L3PfhhwUjQwkkkjPRPeAsxLg9hTz5mFkmT6NSLbfqpDgZt3LsYOIl0=)\n[5] apidog.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFSYL_BGP9APj7LEarIJT25wyio1eC_GN8nH9gwfZWf6FNGjqdgDfmb00s3aTvXpeXUGLfsRrf3IRYLa8ZKSoNKC2EFWvaNS_aUTjO0YX9L2WqtCa4VWKVggrYDMpNUblV8J6RBy31mfR1tCXgp)\n[6] youtube.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFm4iDb5M4EzElGXWPtK-g_apZWqQ7g0XBw-rXjRTHnp7tFd7xYbJ9kUQ-zXc3OWqe1b-3OwC5Ki7zjLbvPZSqsu1XMDsyhtpUpNGEYC0WYlfKwDYvkC_KszXDv1qmQ8GRAJQ3RNvk=)\n[7] reddit.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFqAu9kExtFhIwxj3kxmguZH6LPABHeYRrI5BPgfiXblY2cN8Xku1jmy4bHxuMyhifpOGOrAyp0DfN3prOq3UA8UYunYGOYcs4lpCxxWku5_zMQ3veI3PKA9ZAcNugNmn19T206F7iQmB39YIse_NAuIwpQdTYuKaKmU_1T0be6dcDX3OXk-wxZnCbsXUrCIjQXqbietPXAMOVNcA==)"

          "description": "Replaces text within a file. By default, replaces a single occurrence, but can replace multiple occurrences when `expected_replacements` is specified. This tool requires providing significant context around the change to ensure precise targeting. Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace. The tool will replace ALL occurrences that match `old_string` exactly. Ensure the number of replacements matches your expectation.",

This tool requires providing significant context around the change to ensure precise targeting. Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace. The tool will replace ALL occurrences that match `old_string` exactly. Ensure the number of replacements matches your expectation.",
