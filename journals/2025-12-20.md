Here's a breakdown of the session log and a poem based on it:

The session is very simple, with no prompts or responses. It's sourced from "legion-windows" and occurred in the early morning.

> * Dawn of data,
> * Legion's still asleep,
> * Code sleeps, no queries leap.
> * Empty log,
> * Legion waits for its turn,
> * No input, no bits burn,
> * Silence echoes deep.
> * A Windows dream.
> * Source sleeps,
> * Zero.
