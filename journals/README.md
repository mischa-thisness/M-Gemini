# Daily Journals

This directory contains aggregated daily logs of your Gemini CLI sessions.

## 🔄 Automation

These files are automatically generated by **GitHub Actions** (`process_logs.yml`) whenever new logs are pushed to the `Archives/` directory.

### The Script: `scripts/process_logs.py`
The generation logic is handled by a simple Python script that:

1.  **Scans** the `Archives/` directory for Markdown session logs (`session-YYYY-MM-DD*.md`).
2.  **Groups** them by date (based on the filename).
3.  **Concatenates** the full content of all sessions for a given day into a single file.
4.  **Outputs** the result here as `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

## ⚠️ Note on Editing
**Do not edit these files manually.** They are overwritten automatically by the script. If you need to modify a log, edit the specific session file in `Archives/` and the changes will propagate here on the next run.
