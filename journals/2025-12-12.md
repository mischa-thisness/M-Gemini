👤: **find logread.tar**

> 🧠 **Searching for Log File**
> I'm currently trying to find the file `logread.tar`. I think the `glob` tool is the best way to do that, so I'll be implementing that in my process.

> 🛠️ **Called `glob`**
> -> *No files found*

🤖: I'm searching for `logread.tar`.


> 🧠 **Targeting File Location**
> I realized my initial search was too broad. The `glob` didn't find the target, `logread.tar`, in the immediate directory. But, reviewing the initial listing, it's clearly located in `Downloads`. I'll refine my search to target that specific location.

> 🛠️ **Called `glob`**
> -> *Found 1 matching file(s)*

🤖: `logread.tar` was not found in the current directory. I will search for it in the `Downloads` directory, as indicated in the initial file listing.


🤖: I found `logread.tar` at `C:\Users\Mischa\Downloads\logread.tar`.


👤: **find logread.tar**

👤: **hi**

> 🛠️ **Called `glob`**
> -> *No files found*

🤖: I'm searching for `logread.tar` again.


🤖: I already found `logread.tar` in `C:\Users\Mischa\Downloads\logread.tar`. Did you want me to do something else with it?
