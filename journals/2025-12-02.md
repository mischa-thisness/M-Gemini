👤: **intall claude-cli**

> 🧠 **Assessing Installation Method**
> I'm currently focused on the best approach for installing `claude-cli`. My plan is to use `run_shell_command` with `pip`. I'm also preparing to handle potential errors. If `pip` is unavailable or the package is not compatible, I'll need a fallback strategy, although I haven't quite figured it out yet.

> 🧠 **Confirming Package Availability**
> I'm now determining if `claude-cli` is indeed a Python package and accessible via `pip`. Should the initial installation fail, the system needs to report it is not a valid package name. I will then explore other possible causes of failure.

> 🛠️ **Ran `pip`**
> ` pip install claude-cli `
> -> *[{'functionResponse': {'id': 'run_shell_command-1764718994223-08cd8e5b0be998', 'name': 'run_shell_command', 'response': {'error': '[Operation Cancelled] Reason: User cancelled the operation.'}}}]*

🤖: I will use `pip` to install `claude-cli`.


👤: **use choco or other windows package manager that is similar to homebrew**

> 🧠 **Testing Installation Methods**
> I'm currently focused on determining how to install the `claude-cli` package. My initial approach is to try the `choco install claude-cli` command through Chocolatey. This seems like a straightforward first step, and I'll see if it can handle the package installation seamlessly.

🤖: Okay, I will use Chocolatey to install `claude-cli`.
