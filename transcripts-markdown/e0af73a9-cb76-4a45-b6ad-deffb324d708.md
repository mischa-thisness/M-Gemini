do you have control of a browser to automate web interactions, execute JavaScript, and scrape data?

I do not have a direct "remote control" tool for a live web browser. However, I can achieve web automation, JavaScript execution, and scraping through two primary methods:

1.  **`web_fetch` Tool:** I can directly fetch, summarize, and extract specific data from URLs for you.
2.  **Scripting & Automation:** Since you have **Python 3.13** and **Node.js v25** installed, I can write and execute scripts (using libraries like `puppeteer`, `playwright`, `selenium`, or `beautifulsoup`) to perform complex browser automation, execute JavaScript, and scrape dynamic content.

If you have a specific task in mind, just describe it, and I can build the necessary script to handle it.

I'd like to create a github action that scrapes all of my claude.ai conversations from the web app.

To do this, we'll need to create a dedicated repository. The workflow will involve a Node.js script using **Playwright** (a browser automation library) to log in using your session cookie, navigate your chat history, and save the conversations.

Here is the plan:

1.  **Setup:** Create a new directory (e.g., `claude-archiver`) and initialize a Node.js project.
2.  **Scraper Script:** Write a script using Playwright to:
    *   Authenticate using a `CLAUDE_SESSION_KEY` (which you'll store as a GitHub Secret).
    *   Load the chat list from `https://claude.ai`.
    *   Iterate through conversations and extract the message text.
    *   Save the conversations as Markdown files.
3.  **GitHub Action:** Create a `.github/workflows/scrape.yml` file to:
    *   Run on a schedule (e.g., daily) or manually.
    *   Execute the scraper.
    *   Commit and push the new/updated files back to the repository.

**Does this plan sound good?** If so, please confirm the directory name you'd like to use.
