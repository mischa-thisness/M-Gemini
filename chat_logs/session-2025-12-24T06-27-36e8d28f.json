Your task is to analyze the current directory and generate a comprehensive GEMINI.md file to be used as instructional context for future interactions.\n\n**Analysis Process:**\n\n1.  **Initial Exploration:**\n    *   Start by listing the files and directories to get a high-level overview of the structure.\n    *   Read the README file (e.g., `README.md`, `README.txt`) if it exists. This is often the best place to start.\n\n2.  **Iterative Deep Dive (up to 10 files):**\n    *   Based on your initial findings, select a few files that seem most important (e.g., configuration files, main source files, documentation).\n    *   Read them. As you learn more, refine your understanding and decide which files to read next. You don't need to decide all 10 files at once. Let your discoveries guide your exploration.\n\n3.  **Identify Project Type:**\n    *   **Code Project:** Look for clues like `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pom.xml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `build.gradle`, or a `src` directory. If you find them, this is likely a software project.\n    *   **Non-Code Project:** If you don't find code-related files, this might be a directory for documentation, research papers, notes, or something else.\n\n**GEMINI.md Content Generation:**\n\n**For a Code Project:**\n\n*   **Project Overview:** Write a clear and concise summary of the project's purpose, main technologies, and architecture.\n*   **Building and Running:** Document the key commands for building, running, and testing the project. Infer these from the files you've read (e.g., `scripts` in `package.json`, `Makefile`, etc.). If you can't find explicit commands, provide a placeholder with a TODO.\n*   **Development Conventions:** Describe any coding styles, testing practices, or contribution guidelines you can infer from the codebase.\n\n**For a Non-Code Project:**\n\n*   **Directory Overview:** Describe the purpose and contents of the directory. What is it for? What kind of information does it hold?\n*   **Key Files:** List the most important files and briefly explain what they contain.\n*   **Usage:** Explain how the contents of this directory are intended to be used.\n\n**Final Output:**\n\nWrite the complete content to the `GEMINI.md` file. The output must be well-formatted Markdown.\n"

          "description": "This tool can help you list out the current subtasks that are required to be completed for a given user request. The list of subtasks helps you keep track of the current task, organize complex queries and help ensure that you don't miss any steps. With this list, the user can also see the current progress you are making in executing a given task.\n\nDepending on the task complexity, you should first divide a given task into subtasks and then use this tool to list out the subtasks that are required to be completed for a given user request.\nEach of the subtasks should be clear and distinct. \n\nUse this tool for complex queries that require multiple steps. If you find that the request is actually complex after you have started executing the user task, create a todo list and use it. If execution of the user task requires multiple steps, planning and generally is higher complexity than a simple Q&A, use this tool.\n\nDO NOT use this tool for simple tasks that can be completed in less than 2 steps. If the user query is simple and straightforward, do not use the tool. If you can respond with an answer in a single turn then this tool is not required.\n\n## Task state definitions\n\n- pending: Work has not begun on a given subtask.\n- in_progress: Marked just prior to beginning work on a given subtask. You should only have one subtask as in_progress at a time.\n- completed: Subtask was successfully completed with no errors or issues. If the subtask required more steps to complete, update the todo list with the subtasks. All steps should be identified as completed only when they are completed.\n- cancelled: As you update the todo list, some tasks are not required anymore due to the dynamic nature of the task. In this case, mark the subtasks as cancelled.\n\n\n## Methodology for using this tool\n1. Use this todo list as soon as you receive a user request based on the complexity of the task.\n2. Keep track of every subtask that you update the list with.\n3. Mark a subtask as in_progress before you begin working on it. You should only have one subtask as in_progress at a time.\n4. Update the subtask list as you proceed in executing the task. The subtask list is not static and should reflect your progress and current plans, which may evolve as you acquire new information.\n5. Mark a subtask as completed when you have completed it.\n6. Mark a subtask as cancelled if the subtask is no longer needed.\n7. You must update the todo list as soon as you start, stop or cancel a subtask. Don't batch or wait to update the todo list.\n\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser request: Create a website with a React for creating fancy logos using gemini-2.5-flash-image\n\nToDo list created by the agent:\n1. Initialize a new React project environment (e.g., using Vite).\n2. Design and build the core UI components: a text input (prompt field) for the logo description, selection controls for style parameters (if the API supports them), and an image preview area.\n3. Implement state management (e.g., React Context or Zustand) to manage the user's input prompt, the API loading status (pending, success, error), and the resulting image data.\n4. Create an API service module within the React app (using \"fetch\" or \"axios\") to securely format and send the prompt data via an HTTP POST request to the specified \"gemini-2.5-flash-image\" (Gemini model) endpoint.\n5. Implement asynchronous logic to handle the API call: show a loading indicator while the request is pending, retrieve the generated image (e.g., as a URL or base64 string) upon success, and display any errors.\n6. Display the returned \"fancy logo\" from the API response in the preview area component.\n7. Add functionality (e.g., a \"Download\" button) to allow the user to save the generated image file.\n8. Deploy the application to a web server or hosting platform.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe agent used the todo list to break the task into distinct, manageable steps:\n1. Building an entire interactive web application from scratch is a highly complex, multi-stage process involving setup, UI development, logic integration, and deployment.\n2. The agent inferred the core functionality required for a \"logo creator,\" such as UI controls for customization (Task 3) and an export feature (Task 7), which must be tracked as distinct goals.\n3. The agent rightly inferred the requirement of an API service model for interacting with the image model endpoint.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser request: Ensure that the test <test file> passes.\n\nAgent:\n<Goes into a loop of running the test, identifying errors, and updating the code until the test passes.>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe agent did not use the todo list because this task could be completed by a tight loop of execute test->edit->execute test.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n",

          "description": "This tool can help you list out the current subtasks that are required to be completed for a given user request. The list of subtasks helps you keep track of the current task, organize complex queries and help ensure that you don't miss any steps. With this list, the user can also see the current progress you are making in executing a given task.\n\nDepending on the task complexity, you should first divide a given task into subtasks and then use this tool to list out the subtasks that are required to be completed for a given user request.\nEach of the subtasks should be clear and distinct. \n\nUse this tool for complex queries that require multiple steps. If you find that the request is actually complex after you have started executing the user task, create a todo list and use it. If execution of the user task requires multiple steps, planning and generally is higher complexity than a simple Q&A, use this tool.\n\nDO NOT use this tool for simple tasks that can be completed in less than 2 steps. If the user query is simple and straightforward, do not use the tool. If you can respond with an answer in a single turn then this tool is not required.\n\n## Task state definitions\n\n- pending: Work has not begun on a given subtask.\n- in_progress: Marked just prior to beginning work on a given subtask. You should only have one subtask as in_progress at a time.\n- completed: Subtask was successfully completed with no errors or issues. If the subtask required more steps to complete, update the todo list with the subtasks. All steps should be identified as completed only when they are completed.\n- cancelled: As you update the todo list, some tasks are not required anymore due to the dynamic nature of the task. In this case, mark the subtasks as cancelled.\n\n\n## Methodology for using this tool\n1. Use this todo list as soon as you receive a user request based on the complexity of the task.\n2. Keep track of every subtask that you update the list with.\n3. Mark a subtask as in_progress before you begin working on it. You should only have one subtask as in_progress at a time.\n4. Update the subtask list as you proceed in executing the task. The subtask list is not static and should reflect your progress and current plans, which may evolve as you acquire new information.\n5. Mark a subtask as completed when you have completed it.\n6. Mark a subtask as cancelled if the subtask is no longer needed.\n7. You must update the todo list as soon as you start, stop or cancel a subtask. Don't batch or wait to update the todo list.\n\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser request: Create a website with a React for creating fancy logos using gemini-2.5-flash-image\n\nToDo list created by the agent:\n1.

          "description": "This tool can help you list out the current subtasks that are required to be completed for a given user request. The list of subtasks helps you keep track of the current task, organize complex queries and help ensure that you don't miss any steps. With this list, the user can also see the current progress you are making in executing a given task.\n\nDepending on the task complexity, you should first divide a given task into subtasks and then use this tool to list out the subtasks that are required to be completed for a given user request.\nEach of the subtasks should be clear and distinct. \n\nUse this tool for complex queries that require multiple steps. If you find that the request is actually complex after you have started executing the user task, create a todo list and use it. If execution of the user task requires multiple steps, planning and generally is higher complexity than a simple Q&A, use this tool.\n\nDO NOT use this tool for simple tasks that can be completed in less than 2 steps. If the user query is simple and straightforward, do not use the tool. If you can respond with an answer in a single turn then this tool is not required.\n\n## Task state definitions\n\n- pending: Work has not begun on a given subtask.\n- in_progress: Marked just prior to beginning work on a given subtask. You should only have one subtask as in_progress at a time.\n- completed: Subtask was successfully completed with no errors or issues. If the subtask required more steps to complete, update the todo list with the subtasks. All steps should be identified as completed only when they are completed.\n- cancelled: As you update the todo list, some tasks are not required anymore due to the dynamic nature of the task. In this case, mark the subtasks as cancelled.\n\n\n## Methodology for using this tool\n1. Use this todo list as soon as you receive a user request based on the complexity of the task.\n2. Keep track of every subtask that you update the list with.\n3. Mark a subtask as in_progress before you begin working on it. You should only have one subtask as in_progress at a time.\n4. Update the subtask list as you proceed in executing the task. The subtask list is not static and should reflect your progress and current plans, which may evolve as you acquire new information.\n5. Mark a subtask as completed when you have completed it.\n6. Mark a subtask as cancelled if the subtask is no longer needed.\n7. You must update the todo list as soon as you start, stop or cancel a subtask. Don't batch or wait to update the todo list.\n\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser request: Create a website with a React for creating fancy logos using gemini-2.5-flash-image\n\nToDo list created by the agent:\n1. Initialize a new React project environment (e.g., using Vite).\n2. Design and build the core UI components: a text input (prompt field) for the logo description, selection controls for style parameters (if the API supports them), and an image preview area.\n3. Implement state management (e.g., React Context or Zustand) to manage the user's input prompt, the API loading status (pending, success, error), and the resulting image data.\n4. Create an API service module within the React app (using \"fetch\" or \"axios\") to securely format and send the prompt data via an HTTP POST request to the specified \"gemini-2.5-flash-image\" (Gemini model) endpoint.\n5. Implement asynchronous logic to handle the API call: show a loading indicator while the request is pending, retrieve the generated image (e.g., as a URL or base64 string) upon success, and display any errors.\n6. Display the returned \"fancy logo\" from the API response in the preview area component.\n7. Add functionality (e.g., a \"Download\" button) to allow the user to save the generated image file.\n8. Deploy the application to a web server or hosting platform.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe agent used the todo list to break the task into distinct, manageable steps:\n1. Building an entire interactive web application from scratch is a highly complex, multi-stage process involving setup, UI development, logic integration, and deployment.\n2. The agent inferred the core functionality required for a \"logo creator,\" such as UI controls for customization (Task 3) and an export feature (Task 7), which must be tracked as distinct goals.\n3. The agent rightly inferred the requirement of an API service model for interacting with the image model endpoint.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser request: Ensure that the test <test file> passes.\n\nAgent:\n<Goes into a loop of running the test, identifying errors, and updating the code until the test passes.>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe agent did not use the todo list because this task could be completed by a tight loop of execute test->edit->execute test.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n",

It was bootstrapped by Gemini and consists of a basic HTML file, a stylesheet for styling, and a JavaScript file for minimal interactivity. The purpose of this project is to serve as a playground for web development experiments with Gemini.\n\n**Technologies:**\n*   HTML5\n*   CSS3\n*   JavaScript\n\n**Architecture:**\n*   `index.html`: The main entry point and structure of the web page.\n*   `style.css`: Provides the visual styling for the application.\n*   `script.js`: Contains the client-side scripting logic.\n\n## Building and Running\n\nThis is a static web project. No build process is required.\n\n**To run the application:**\n\n1.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.\n\n**Testing:**\n\nThere are no automated tests for this project. To test, open the `index.html` file and verify the following:\n*   The page displays the \"Welcome to Gemini Playground!\" heading.\n*   The browser's developer console logs \"Hello from Gemini Playground!\".\n*   The page has a light gray background, and the heading text is dark gray.\n\n## Development Conventions\n\n*   **File Structure:** All files are located in the root directory.\n*   **Styling:** CSS is used for styling and is defined in `style.css`.\n*   **Scripting:** JavaScript is used for interactivity and is defined in `script.js`.\n",
