**You:** fix hung/stalled cosmic-store app

<details><summary>💭 thoughts</summary>

- **Assessing Cosmic-Store Issues**: I'm focused on troubleshooting a stalled `cosmic-store` application. My immediate goal is to ascertain whether any processes are currently running for this app. If I find them, I'll proceed with termination as a likely solution.

- **Enumerating Process Steps**: I'm now formulating a plan. I will begin by enumerating processes that match `cosmic-store`. I'll present the user with details, then seek confirmation before attempting to kill any found processes. If nothing is running, I'll provide appropriate feedback.

</details>

**Tool Call:** `run_shell_command`
```json
{
  "command": "pgrep -af cosmic-store"
}
```
> 130096 cosmic-store
134510 [cosmic-store] <defunct>
134602 [cosmic-store] <defunct>
149597 cosmic-store
166805 bash -c shopt -u promptvars nullglob extglob nocaseglob dotglob; { pgrep -af cosmic-store; }; __code=$?; pgrep -g 0 >/tmp/shell_pgrep_304e7544f742.tmp 2>&1; exit $__code;

**Gemini:** I will search for any running `cosmic-store` processes.

- **Investigating Process States**: I'm currently observing several `cosmic-store` processes. I see active instances running under PIDs 130096 and 149597. There are also two defunct (zombie) processes, under PIDs 134510 and 134602. It seems like the defunct ones will resolve themselves. I need to consider killing the active processes to resolve the problem.

- **Analyzing Application State**: I've decided to proceed directly to the fix. Since the user wants a stalled app unstuck, and killing the active processes seems like the immediate solution. I will attempt a graceful termination (SIGTERM) of the active processes, as that's the preferred method. I'll inform the user of this action.

**Tool Call:** `run_shell_command`
```json
{
  "command": "kill 130096 149597"
}
```
> Result received.

**Gemini:** I found two active `cosmic-store` processes (PIDs 130096 and 149597) and a couple of defunct ones. I will attempt to terminate the active processes to resolve the stall.

- **Assessing Command Execution**: I've confirmed the `kill` command's success; a SIGTERM was sent. Now, I must confirm process termination. I plan to use `pgrep` to check for lingering processes, as some may not respond to the signal. This step is crucial to ensure the intended outcome.

**Tool Call:** `run_shell_command`
```json
{
  "command": "pgrep -af cosmic-store"
}
```

**Gemini:** I have sent a termination signal to the processes. I will now verify if they have successfully closed.

- **Announcing App Termination**: I'm pleased to report that the `pgrep` command no longer flags `cosmic-store` processes. This crucial indicator confirms the processes have ceased operations. I'm ready to relay the successful shutdown to the user.

</details>

**Gemini:** The `cosmic-store` processes have been successfully terminated. You should be able to restart the application now.
