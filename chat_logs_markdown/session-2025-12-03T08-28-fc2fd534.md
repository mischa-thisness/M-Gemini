**Gemini:** I will install Ansible using Chocolatey. This command will add Ansible to your system via the Chocolatey package manager.


<details><summary>💭 thoughts</summary>

- **Checking Ansible Package Availability**: I'm currently trying to confirm the existence of the 'ansible' package on Chocolatey. It seems the initial attempt to install it failed. My hypothesis is a potential misspelling, an unavailable package source, or possibly a network glitch. The next step is to perform a direct search within Chocolatey to verify its availability.

- **Confirming Package Lookup Strategy**: I've just finished the search and verified the correct package name. My plan is now to review the Chocolatey configuration, specifically the package sources. It's possible a custom source is missing, or the default source isn't enabled. A more targeted approach to resolve the installation issue is now in progress.

**Gemini:** Chocolatey couldn't find the `ansible` package. I'll search Chocolatey's package list to confirm its name and availability.


**Tool Call:** `google_web_search`
```json
{
  "query": "ansible chocolatey package"
}
```
> Search results for "ansible chocolatey package" returned.

**Gemini:** "Ansible" isn't a direct Chocolatey package; `choco search ansible` only yielded related tools. It's likely unavailable in the default community feed, suggesting Python's `pip` as an alternative. Before proposing `pip`, I'll check the Chocolatey website for alternative package names or official installation guidance.


<details><summary>💭 thoughts</summary>

- **Considering the Relationships**: My current thinking centers on the interaction between Ansible and Chocolatey. I've noted that Ansible doesn't install Chocolatey packages *through* Chocolatey; instead, it leverages a specific module to manage packages *on* Windows systems. This is an important distinction to make. I'm focusing now on the best way to represent this.

- **Clarifying the Process**: I'm now formulating a response to the user, grounded in the understanding that Ansible isn't installed via Chocolatey. My current focus is how best to explain this. I'll need to make it clear that Ansible's installation method differs from the user's assumption. Furthermore, I will offer a clear path forward: installing Python and then installing Ansible with pip. I'm keen on a response that is helpful and direct.

**Gemini:** Ansible isn't a direct Chocolatey package for self-installation; it utilizes a Chocolatey module for Windows host management. The user's request stems from a misunderstanding. I'll explain this, then propose installing Python and subsequently Ansible via `pip`, and finally ask if they wish to proceed with Python installation.I understand you'd like to install Ansible via Chocolatey. However, based on my search and Chocolatey's typical usage, Ansible itself isn't directly available as a package to *install* through Chocolatey.

- **Considering Python and Pip**: I'm presently focused on the initial setup. I'm verifying Python's presence with `python --version`. If it's absent, or the version is insufficient, I'll install it as a preliminary step. My next action will be to proceed with installing Ansible using `pip`.

- **Defining the Workflow**: I've outlined the critical steps, including Python's verification and installation, and the `pip install ansible` command. I'm now setting up a todo list to systematically track each task and ensure nothing is overlooked.

- **Confirming Environment Variables**: I've just installed Python and am working on updating the environment variables. I'm choosing between using "refreshen v" (per the Chocolatey suggestion) or just trying the subsequent commands directly. The non-interactive shell environment adds another layer of consideration for the refresh procedure.

- **Refreshing the Shell**: After the install, the output indicated that a refresh was needed. So, I ran `refreshenv` as suggested by Chocolatey. Now, I will confirm the Python installation by checking its version. The shim suggests it should work, but I'll make sure the environment variables are correctly updated to reflect the new path.

- **Considering Environment Issues**: I've determined that the environment variables didn't update as expected, leaving Python commands unrecognized. To bypass this, I'll specify the full path to the executable, using `C:\Python314\python.exe` to run Python directly, to get past the initial hurdle.

- **Re-Evaluating Execution Paths**: I've tested the full path method; explicitly calling `C:\Python314\python.exe` resolved the 'Python not found' error. This confirms the environment variable issue. Next, I plan to invoke `pip` using its full path. After that, I will attempt to install the required libraries.

**Tool Call:** `run_shell_command`
```json
{
  "description": "Check Python version using the full path.",
  "command": "C:\\Python314\\python.exe --version"
}
```
> Python 3.14.0


**You:** is python installed?
