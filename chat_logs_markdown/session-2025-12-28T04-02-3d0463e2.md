**You:** install 1password cli tool for CachyOS cosmic

<details><summary>💭 thoughts</summary>

- **Verifying Package Availability**: I'm currently verifying the package availability. Given that CachyOS is based on Arch Linux, the Arch User Repository (AUR) is the primary resource to check. Additionally, I am checking the potential for an official repository from 1Password itself, which could simplify installation.

- **Evaluating Installation Options**: I've moved on to assessing the installation methods. My focus is now on the official repositories first, using `pacman`. Failing that, the AUR is the next step. Since `yay` and `paru` seem to be installed, I'll leverage one of those for AUR package management if necessary.

</details>

**Tool Call:** `run_shell_command`
```json
{
  "description": "Searching for 1password-cli in the official repositories.",
  "command": "pacman -Ss 1password-cli"
}
```
> Command exited with code: 1

**Gemini:** I will search for the 1Password CLI package in the repositories.

- **Checking Availability**: I've hit a small snag. It's not in the usual places, so I'll need to use `yay` to search the AUR. Hopefully, it's available there. This will determine the next steps.

</details>

**Tool Call:** `run_shell_command`
```json
{
  "command": "yay -Ss 1password-cli",
  "description": "Searching for 1password-cli in the AUR."
}
```
> aur/1password-cli 2.32.0-2 ([REDACTED_PHONE].51) 
    1Password command line tool

**Gemini:** I will search for the 1Password CLI in the AUR using `yay`.

- **Evaluating Installation Options**: I've decided to proceed with installing `1password-cli` from the AUR using `yay`. For automation, I'll incorporate the `--noconfirm` flag. I anticipate the installation will proceed without interactive prompts, though a confirmation dialog for the user will likely still appear.

- **Assessing the Command Structure**: I'm now honing in on the exact command. The core is `yay -S 1password-cli`. Adding `--noconfirm` is key for streamlining. This should allow a smooth, automated installation without unwanted prompts, even though a user confirmation will likely pop up.

**Tool Call:** `run_shell_command`
```json
{
  "command": "yay -S --noconfirm 1password-cli",
  "description": "Installing 1password-cli from the AUR."
}

<details><summary>💭 thoughts</summary>

- **Verifying Installation Success**: I've just installed `password-cli`. Now, I'm checking the version number to confirm the installation completed without errors. The next step will be to explore the available commands.

</details>

**Tool Call:** `run_shell_command`
```json
{
  "command": "op --version",
  "description": "Verifying the installation by checking the version of op."
}
```
> 2.32.0

**Gemini:** I've successfully installed 1password-cli. I'll verify the installation by checking the version.


<details><summary>💭 thoughts</summary>

- **Analyzing User Intent**: I've determined the user has the 1Password CLI installed, which is great. It looks like they're asking for help with a "CachyOS cosmic" setup. While the term "cosmic" typically means the COSMIC desktop environment, I realize 1Password's CLI tool doesn't have a version specifically for that. I should clarify that.

- **Clarifying User Needs**: I'm now zeroing in on the specifics. The user likely wants the 1Password CLI on their CachyOS setup, which makes sense. I see their request, so I've moved past assuming they were requesting a specific "cosmic" build. I'm focusing on providing the basic CLI functionality requested. I also realize that I need to clarify whether they need additional integrations or just the CLI. I'm also checking for the `1password` group on the system for biometric unlocking configuration.

</details>

**Tool Call:** `run_shell_command`
```json
{
  "description": "Checking for the 1password group in /etc/group.",
  "command": "grep 1password /etc/group"
}
```
> Command exited with code: 1

**Gemini:** I'll check if the '1password' group was created during installation to see if additional configuration for biometric unlock is needed.

- **Investigating 1password Setup**: I'm focused on the requested installation of 1password. The initial assessment is that a group might not be relevant, and the GUI package may handle system integration better than the CLI. My next step is to determine if the user requires the GUI application alongside the command-line tool or if a sign-in is needed.

- **Finalizing 1Password Solution**: I've completed the installation, assessing the lack of a relevant group. My focus remained on the core request: the command-line tool. The user-provided prompt seemed to indicate that the GUI application was unnecessary.

</details>

**Gemini:** The 1Password CLI (`op`) has been installed successfully on your CachyOS system. You can now use it by running the `op` command.

```bash
op --version
# Output: 2.32.0
```

To get started, you can sign in to your account:
```bash
op account add
```

If you also need the 1Password GUI application or want to enable features like biometric unlock, please let me know
