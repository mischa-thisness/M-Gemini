- **Assessing Installation Method**: I'm currently focused on the best approach for installing `claude-cli`. My plan is to use `run_shell_command` with `pip`. I'm also preparing to handle potential errors. If `pip` is unavailable or the package is not compatible, I'll need a fallback strategy, although I haven't quite figured it out yet.

- **Confirming Package Availability**: I'm now determining if `claude-cli` is indeed a Python package and accessible via `pip`. Should the initial installation fail, the system needs to report it is not a valid package name. I will then explore other possible causes of failure.

**Tool Call:** `run_shell_command`
```json

**Gemini:** I will use `pip` to install `claude-cli`.
