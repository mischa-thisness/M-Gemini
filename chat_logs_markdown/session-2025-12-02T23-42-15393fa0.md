🤖: I will use `pip` to install `claude-cli`.

- <details><summary>🧠 Assessing Installation Method</summary>I'm currently focused on the best approach for installing `claude-cli`. My plan is to use `run_shell_command` with `pip`. I'm also preparing to handle potential errors. If `pip` is unavailable or the package is not compatible, I'll need a fallback strategy, although I haven't quite figured it out yet.</details>
- <details><summary>🧠 Confirming Package Availability</summary>I'm now determining if `claude-cli` is indeed a Python package and accessible via `pip`. Should the initial installation fail, the system needs to report it is not a valid package name. I will then explore other possible causes of failure.</details>

🤖: Okay, I will use Chocolatey to install `claude-cli`.

- <details><summary>🧠 Testing Installation Methods</summary>I'm currently focused on determining how to install the `claude-cli` package. My initial approach is to try the `choco install claude-cli` command through Chocolatey. This seems like a straightforward first step, and I'll see if it can handle the package installation seamlessly.</details>
