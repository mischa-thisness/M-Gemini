**You:** install LatencyMon

<details><summary>💭 thoughts</summary>

- **Analyzing Installation Options**: I've determined the user is on Windows, specifically `win32`. I'm investigating how software is installed, and initial checks point toward Chocolatey being a possible package manager, seeing as there's a `.chocolatey` folder. I'm now proceeding to confirm Chocolatey's availability before recommending installation steps.

- **Confirming Package Managers**: I'm presently focused on verifying the presence of package managers. I've initiated checks for both `choco` and `winget`. Based on initial findings, I'll prioritize `choco` if available, and then proceed with `winget`, as it's a built-in option. Following this, I'll determine how to proceed with the LatencyMon installation based on the findings.

- **Testing Installation Methods**: I've begun by checking the availability of LatencyMon through Chocolatey. If that doesn't work, I'll switch gears and try winget. Right now, I'm waiting for `choco` to finish its search.

- **Investigating Package Sources**: Okay, the Chocolatey search completed. It seems like LatencyMon isn't directly available. Now, I'm shifting to `winget`. I'll run a search there and see if it yields any better results. This should give me a more definitive answer on the availability through common package managers.

- **Evaluating Installation Strategy**: I've confirmed `latencymon` is in Chocolatey. My immediate plan is to install it via `choco install`. I must consider that this might need admin rights, and my session may not have them. I'll test the install command first, and if it fails, I'll troubleshoot the privilege escalation.

- **Planning the Implementation Steps**: I'm now adding the `-y` flag to the `choco install` command to automatically confirm the installation. This is a small, pragmatic step. I anticipate permission errors, but the automated confirmation should streamline the process, assuming the installation progresses.

- **Considering Choco Failure**: I've determined that the Chocolatey installation failed due to insufficient permissions. The error messages clearly pointed to a lack of administrative access. Now, I'm pivoting to explore `winget` as an alternative package manager, hoping it can circumvent the permission issue.

- **Evaluating Winget's Potential**: I'm now investigating `winget`'s capabilities. Specifically, I'm initiating a search for "latencymon" within the `winget` ecosystem. My goal is to determine if `winget` can successfully install the desired package when Chocolatey failed due to permission constraints. I'm hopeful that `winget` can provide a smoother installation experience.

LatencyMon Resplendence.LatencyMon 7.31    winget


<details><summary>💭 thoughts</summary>

- **Initiating Installation Attempts**: I'm attempting to install LatencyMon using `winget`. I've included the necessary flags to automatically accept agreements and avoid prompts. I'll monitor the output for any errors.

- **Installing the Package Now**: I'm proceeding with the `winget install` command, including the package name and agreement flags. I'm keeping an eye on the output for any errors, especially related to administrative rights or unexpected prompts. I'm also considering the potential for UAC interaction in this CLI environment.

- **Validating Installation Success**: I've confirmed LatencyMon's successful installation via `winget`. I'm now verifying its presence. I'll inspect the start menu folder and the standard installation directory, which is typically under `C:\Program Files\Resplendence\LatencyMon`, to confirm that it's all in place as expected.

- **Checking Directory Presence**: The start menu check yielded no unexpected results, indicating the expected items are present. I am now double-checking the anticipated installation path, specifically `C:\Program Files\Resplendence\LatencyMon`. I'll confirm the executable and other expected support files are indeed located there.

- **Searching for the Executable**: I've located that LatencyMon wasn't where I initially expected it, in `C:\Program Files\`. Time to cast a wider net. My next step is to investigate the `C:\Program Files (x86)` directory, specifically looking at the Resplendence folder. I'm hoping to find the executable there.
