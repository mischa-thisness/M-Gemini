👤: **install FancyZones app**

- <details><summary>🧠 Determining Installation Method</summary>I'm currently focused on the best approach for installing "FancyZones." It's part of Microsoft PowerToys. Considering I can't directly use an app store or a package manager by default, I'm leaning toward a manual installation method. This seems like the most logical path forward given the constraints.</details>
- <details><summary>🧠 Evaluating Installation Sources</summary>I've begun investigating online resources. I'm prioritizing the official Microsoft PowerToys documentation to understand the prescribed installation process for FancyZones. I anticipate this will involve downloading an installer directly from Microsoft, but I'm looking for specifics on how to ensure secure installation.</details>

👤: **install Intel XTU**

- <details><summary>🧠 Locating Installation Package</summary>I'm currently trying to install "Intel XTU". My initial plan is to use `winget` to locate the appropriate installation package. I'm hoping this will streamline the process.</details>
- <details><summary>🛠️ Ran `winget`</summary>

  **Input**:

  ```
  **Output**:
  > No package found matching input criteria.
  </details>

- <details><summary>🧠 Investigating Installation Methods</summary>I've hit a snag with `winget`. It couldn't find "Intel XTU." This strongly suggests a problem with the package listing or the name. My next step is a web search to identify the proper installation procedure, and any potential naming variations.</details>
- <details><summary>🛠️ Called `google_web_search`</summary>

  **Input**:
  ```json
{
  "query": "install Intel XTU"
}
  ```
  **Output**:
  > Search results for "install Intel XTU" returned.
  </details>

🤖: Intel XTU is not available via `winget`. Installation requires downloading an executable from the official Intel website.

**Important Considerations Before Installation:**

*   **Processor Compatibility:** Intel XTU only supports unlocked Intel K- and X-series processors. You must check the Intel website to ensure your CPU is supported. There are different versions (7.14 and 10.0) depending on your processor generation.
*   **Manual Download:** You will need to manually download the `XTUSetup.exe` file from the official Intel Download Center.

**To install Intel XTU, please follow these steps:**

1.  **Visit the official Intel XTU download page.** (You can search "Intel XTU download" to find it).
2.  **Verify your processor's compatibility** on the download page.
3.  **Download the correct `XTUSetup.exe`** for your specific processor.
4.  **Run the downloaded `XTUSetup.exe`** and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. A system reboot may be required.

I cannot automate this process due to the manual download and compatibility check requirements.
