**Gemini:** I will run `cosmic-randr list` to verify that the scaling has been successfully updated to 115%.


<details><summary>💭 thoughts</summary>

- **Examining Percentage Discrepancies**: I'm currently investigating the unexpected "114%" value. My initial hunch was a misrepresentation, but the value was initially "1 25%," so rounding could be the culprit. I'm now exploring if the underlying calculation of 1.15 is producing a rounded result that explains the 114% value.

- **Evaluating Scaling Precision**: I've tested various scaling factors, including `1.15` and `1.16`, to address the 114% display discrepancy. The system seems to be rounding the display, as the precise input doesn't always guarantee the desired output. I'm considering the potential for more precise values or direct percentage input, but the `--help` output uses `<SCALE>`. I'm now trying to check the percentage suffix.

</details>

```json
{
  "description": "Try setting scale with percentage.",
  "command": "cosmic-randr mode eDP-2 2560 1600 --scale 115%"
}
```
> error: invalid value '115%' for '--scale <SCALE>': invalid float literal

For more information, try '--help'.

**Gemini:** I will try setting the scale using the percentage suffix (115%) to see if it provides a more accurate result.


<details><summary>💭 thoughts</summary>

- **Examining Precision Issues**: I'm currently investigating how Python handles floating-point numbers. It seems that the exact representation of a float might not always align with the user's expected input. Initially, I thought that `list` might just round down a float, but the "114%" value implies something closer to 1.15. I'm starting to suspect that `1.15` might be precise enough, or it may involve a slight loss of precision during storage.

- **Verifying Numerical Representation**: I'm now focusing on how the percentage is being displayed. I've set the value to `1.15` and I'm still seeing `114%`. This leads me to believe the display might be rounding, however, I need to see the raw value to be certain. I am exploring alternative methods to set the value. Specifically, I'm checking for a `cosmic-settings` CLI to adjust the value more directly and examine how it displays.

**Gemini:** I will install `cosmic-store` using `sudo pacman -S --noconfirm`.


**Gemini:** `cosmic-store` has been successfully installed.


**You:** failed to install [...] ... The name is not activatable

<details><summary>💭 thoughts</summary>

- **Debugging the Error Message**: I'm currently focused on the "The name is not activatable" error after installing `cosmic-store`. My thinking leans towards a D-Bus problem, since that's a common cause. I'm going to start by checking D-Bus configuration and service availability.

- **Pinpointing the Cause**: I've moved on to examining the exact context of the error. Running `cosmic-store` from the command line seems like the next logical step. I'm hoping to get more detailed error messages that might pinpoint whether it's a D-Bus issue, a missing dependency, or a configuration problem specific to the flatpak or packagekit setup. I also plan to dig into the D-Bus logs for more hints.

</details>

**Tool Call:** `run_shell_command`
```json
{
  "command": "cosmic-store",
  "description": "Launch cosmic-store to check for errors."
}
```
> Result received.

**Gemini:** I will attempt to launch `cosmic-store` from the command line to capture the exact error message and context.


<details><summary>💭 thoughts</summary>

- **Considering Silent Failures**: I'm now contemplating the possibility of a silent failure, considering the lack of output from `cosmic-store`. The exit code 0 is misleading and I'm looking into how this command could have started but ultimately failed without leaving any trace in the standard error stream. This needs more investigation.

- **Pinpointing Potential Culprits**: The D-Bus error "The name is not activatable" now points to `cosmic-store` attempting to contact a service like `PackageKit` or `Flatpak`.  The "Native packages support" dependency on `PackageKit` solidifies this theory. I'll check if either service is running, as a missing or non-running service is very probable cause. I also have to consider the fact the installation may have failed before it even got this far.

- **Checking PackageKit's Presence**: I now understand that the D-Bus error combined with the output about `packagekit` strongly suggests `cosmic-store` depends on it. My current line of thought is to check for `packagekit`'s installation. It is a highly probable cause if it's not installed or running. I also need to verify that `flatpak` isn't causing issues, as it is a common package manager too.

**Tool Call:** `run_shell_command`
```json
{
  "command": "pacman -Qi packagekit",

**Gemini:** I will check if `packagekit` is installed, as it is an optional dependency for `cosmic-store` that handles native package support.


<details><summary>💭 thoughts</summary>

- **Analyzing PackageKit Dependency**: I'm now zeroing in on the absence of `packagekit`. I'm starting to think this missing dependency is blocking `cosmic-store` from doing its job, especially since it needs to talk to `org.freedesktop.PackageKit` via D-Bus. That "not activatable" error is a major red flag, pointing directly at this missing component.

- **Pinpointing the Culprit**: I've isolated `packagekit` as the primary suspect. My current line of reasoning is that the `cosmic-store` is trying to access `org.freedesktop.PackageKit` via D-Bus, and the "not activatable" error strongly confirms this. Now, my next move is clear, as I will proceed to install this critical missing component.

**Gemini:** I will install `packagekit` to provide the necessary D-Bus service for `cosmic-store`.


<details><summary>💭 thoughts</summary>

- **Verifying Packagekit Installation**: Now that I've installed `packagekit`, my primary focus is confirmation. I'll be checking for the `org.freedesktop.PackageKit` D-Bus name. A status check or simply observing that the installation completed successfully should be enough to confirm `packagekit` is up and running, hopefully resolving the `cosmic-store` activation issues.

- **Validating D-Bus Presence**: Following the successful installation of `packagekit`, my thoughts now center on the D-Bus service. I'm focusing on confirming the `org.freedesktop.PackageKit` presence to ensure `cosmic-store` can now activate. A simple status check should suffice, and a retry by the user is the next logical step.

</details>

**Gemini:** `packagekit` was missing, which is required for `cosmic-store` to manage native packages. I have installed it, which should resolve the "The name is not activatable" error. You can now try using `cosmic-store` again.


**You:** fix "no installed applications"

<details><summary>💭 thoughts</summary>

- **Troubleshooting Package Managers**: I'm currently investigating a "no installed applications" problem reported by a user, likely stemming from issues with `cosmic-store` or a similar application manager. The root cause appears to be that the package manager backend, specifically PackageKit, might not have synchronized properly, lacks sufficient permissions, or has configuration problems preventing it from recognizing the installed packages.

- **Pinpointing the PackageKit Issue**: After examining `libpackagekit-glib`, I'm moving toward troubleshooting the `packagekit` backend and cache. I'll verify if the Arch-specific backend is enabled, or if it's missing entirely. Following that, I'll attempt a cache refresh to ensure the package database is up-to-date. Finally, I will check related logs for error messages.

- **Assessing the pkcon Tool**: I'm now running `pkcon` commands to troubleshoot package visibility. My immediate aim is to see if `pkcon` itself can list installed packages. If successful, I'll know the core PackageKit setup is working and that the problem is localized to `cosmic-store`. Failing that, it's a deeper PackageKit issue. I'll then move on to checking for available backends.

**Gemini:** I will check if PackageKit is functioning correctly by listing installed packages using `pkcon`.


<details><summary>💭 thoughts</summary>

- **Inspecting PackageKit Behavior**: I've confirmed that `pkcon get-packages` successfully retrieves installed package information, including `cosmic-store` and `packagekit` itself. This confirms `packagekit` is operational and can access the package database. My focus now is on why `cosmic-store` might not be displaying the installed applications, despite this.

- **Evaluating Potential Root Causes**: I'm now zeroing in on why `cosmic-store` is not displaying applications, despite PackageKit's functionality. I suspect AppStream data problems, a caching issue, or perhaps a backend discrepancy within `cosmic-store`. I've confirmed `archlinux-appstream-data` is present, but I'll refresh its cache and restart PackageKit. I'm also planning to check `cosmic-store`'s cache and verify Flatpak integration.

- **Investigating Cosmic-Store Integration**: I've examined the problem more closely and believe that `cosmic-store` might rely heavily on AppStream data to display applications. I'll refresh the AppStream cache using `pkcon refresh force` and then restart the PackageKit service. I am going to see if appstreamcli is available. Considering the relatively new nature of `cosmic-store`, I will investigate its interaction with Flatpaks, especially since I see `flatpak` installed. I will now examine any possible `cosmic-store` cache locations.

**Gemini:** I will refresh the PackageKit cache to ensure it has the latest package information.
