🤖: I will now find the installation path of the `PerfTune.exe` process to check if it offers a command-line interface for more advanced overclocking options.

- <details><summary>🧠 Analyzing Clock States</summary>I've been examining the output of `nvidia-smi -q -d SUPPORTED_CLOCKS`, and it's quite extensive. It details a wide array of supported graphics and memory clock combinations, confirming the driver exposes these states. The maximum graphics clock observed is 3090 MHz. This strongly suggests that utilizing `-lgc` might be a viable approach.</details>
- <details><summary>🧠 Verifying Tool Availability</summary>I'm now diving into the `nvidia-smi` help documentation to confirm the exact syntax for `-lgc` (low graphics clock) and `-pl` (power limit). While I expect the syntax to be standard, it's always best to double-check. Simultaneously, I'm trying to locate `PerfTune.exe`, which I identified previously via PID. My plan is to use PowerShell to track it down. If it offers a CLI or configuration file, it could be the ticket to applying proper offsets.</details>
- <details><summary>🧠 Discovering Tuning Path</summary>I'm pursuing a dual-pronged approach to implement proper offsets. First, I'll attempt using `nvidia-smi` with arguments like `-lgc` to cap the clocks.

  </details>

🤖: I will query the current and maximum power limits of your GPU to determine the safe range for adjustment.

- <details><summary>🧠 Reassessing Utility Identification</summary>I've made a crucial correction in my understanding. I now realize that PerfTune.exe actually refers to Intel's XTU, not a GPU overclocking tool as I initially believed. This means the assumption of a vendor-specific GPU tuning utility active in the background is now obsolete, and requires further investigation.</details>
- <details><summary>🧠 Focusing On NVIDIA Control</summary>I've shifted my focus to `nvidia-smi` as the primary tool. Given that Intel XTU is now ruled out, and assuming the lack of cross-compatibility, I plan to leverage `nvidia-smi`'s capabilities. My current thinking revolves around power limits and clock locking to optimize performance, avoiding true overclocking (which typically requires separate GUI tools). I'll start by querying for the current and max power limits to inform the command construction.</details>
- <details><summary>🧠 Extracting Power Data</summary>Now, I'm trying to gather more data on power consumption. I am using `nvidia-smi` to extract both current and maximum power limit values. Using this data, I intend to craft commands aimed at optimizing performance within these constraints.</details>

🤖: I will attempt to re-apply the current maximum power limit of 175W to verify if I have the necessary Administrator privileges to modify GPU settings.

- <details><summary>🧠 Investigating Power Limits</summary>I'm focusing on the power limits now. Specifically, I'm struck by the discrepancy between the default power limit (95W) and the current/maximum limit (175W). It's peculiar that the card is already at its maximum, especially without a clear cause. This deviation from the default state warrants closer examination, as it could indicate prior configuration or unusual behavior.</details>
- <details><summary>🧠 Considering Clock Locking & Tools</summary>I'm now contemplating clock locking and the tools available. The vast power limit range still feels odd, potentially hinting at a unique model. I can't exceed 175W. My primary optimization will involve locking the clocks to the high end using `nvidia-smi`, specifically around 3090 MHz. I'll include the command `nvidia-smi -lgc 3000,3090`. Also, I'll recommend the user double-check for administrator privileges if the command doesn't execute as expected. Finally, I'll search for `nvidia-inspector` and other similar tools to broaden the possible CLI overclocking options.</details>
- <details><summary>🧠 Focusing On Command Details</summary>I've streamlined the answer to focus on providing the essential `nvidia-smi` commands directly. I'll highlight the power limit's already maximized state and emphasize using `-lgc` for clock adjustments. I'll include concrete command examples, such as `nvidia-smi` to check the current status, and `nvidia-smi -lgc 2100,3090` to lock the clocks. Also, I'll mention the limitations of this method for "true" overclocking and third-party tool alternatives. Finally, I will make one last check, to ensure no issues arise during the command execution.</details>
- <details><summary>🧠 Verifying Write Access</summary>I'm now thinking about the safest way to test write permissions. Rather than jumping straight to clock adjustments, I'll first try setting the power limit to its current value. This will be a non-intrusive test. The command I'll use is `nvidia-smi -pl 175`, since it's already set to 175W. This should confirm my ability to modify settings without altering performance.</details>
- <details><summary>🛠️ Ran `nvidia-smi`</summary>

  **Input**:
  ```json
{
  "command": "nvidia-smi -pl 175"
}
  ```
  **Output**:
  > Changing power management limit is not supported for GPU: 00000000:02:00.0.
Treating as warning and moving on.
All done.
  </details>

🤖: I will now test if the "Lock GPU Clocks" command is supported by attempting to lock the GPU clock to a wide, safe frequency range (210 MHz to 2100 MHz).

- <details><summary>🧠 Observing Power Restrictions</summary>I've hit a roadblock. It appears adjusting the power limit through `nvidia-smi` isn't feasible for this particular GPU. This likely stems from a driver constraint common with consumer GeForce cards or this specific model. My initial strategy has hit a snag, and I'm now exploring alternative methods to achieve the desired power management.</details>
- <details><summary>🧠 Testing Clock Locking</summary>I'm now focusing on a potential workaround. Since direct power limit adjustments seem blocked, I'm shifting to clock locking via `-lgc`. This may be supported even if power tweaks are not. I'll test it out and see what the status is. If it does not work, then I'll inform the user that only third-party utilities are effective.</details>

  </details>

🤖: I will reset the GPU clocks to their default behavior to ensure the system returns to its normal state before providing the final instructions.

- <details><summary>🧠 Verifying Performance Tweaks</summary>I've confirmed that the `-lgc` flag delivers the expected performance boost, effectively enabling GPU high-performance mode. Now, I'm thinking about the user experience. To avoid unintended consequences, I'll reset the GPU clock settings to their default values using `nvidia-smi -rgc` before finalizing the solution. I don't want to leave the user with an altered GPU configuration.</details>
- <details><summary>🧠 Summarizing CLI Capabilities</summary>Now, I'm synthesizing the CLI findings. `nvidia-smi` is the central tool. I'm noting the rejected Power Limit change and successful Clock Locking support with `-lgc`. The key commands are set: locking clocks to force a high-performance mode, and resetting them. I'll flag the limitations of offset overclocking via the CLI, contrasting this with GUI tools for the user's reference.</details>

🤖: On your Windows system with the **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090**, you can use the native `nvidia-smi` tool for performance tuning.

While "true" overclocking (adding +100MHz offsets) is restricted to GUI tools on GeForce cards, you can **force the GPU to run at its maximum boost frequency** using the command line. This prevents it from downclocking, effectively maximizing performance.

### **1. Check Supported Speeds**
First, verify your card's maximum supported frequency (we found this to be **3090 MHz**):
```powershell
nvidia-smi -q -d SUPPORTED_CLOCKS
```

### **2. Performance Tuning (Lock Clocks)**
To "overclock" by forcing high performance, lock the GPU clock to its upper boost range. This keeps the core clock high even under varying loads.

**Command to lock clocks (High Performance):**
```powershell
# Locks the GPU core between 2500 MHz and 3090 MHz (Max)
nvidia-smi -lgc 2500,3090
```
*Note: Your card's max officially supported clock is 3090 MHz. Setting the lower bound (e.g., 2500) prevents it from idling low during games.*

### **3. Reset to Default**
To return your GPU to stock behavior (allowing it to idle and save power), use the reset command:
```powershell
nvidia-smi -rgc
```

### **Summary of Limitations**
*   **Power Limit:** Your card is currently reporting a max power limit of **175W**, and `nvidia-smi` does not allow increasing this on your specific GeForce driver/model (tested and confirmed "not supported").
*   **Offsets:** Setting a frequency offset (e.g., +150MHz beyond factory limits) is not possible via the standard command line and requires GUI tools like MSI Afterburner or ASUS GPU Tweak.

- <details><summary>🧠 Defining Limitations</summary>I've got the essential system specs in place: Windows with an RTX 5090. I can use `nvidia-smi` natively, which is good. The power limit is fixed at 175W, and I can't change it with `nvidia-smi`. However, I do have clock control available via `-lgc` for locking the GPU clocks.</details>
- <details><summary>🧠 Assessing Performance Control</summary>I'm now zeroing in on `-lgc`. The max supported clock speed is 3090 MHz. I'm focusing on how I can explain to the user that although direct overclocking offsets aren't possible, forcing high clock speeds offers a similar level of control. I'm considering the best way to present this information to the user.</details>
