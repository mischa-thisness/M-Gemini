👤: **Your task is to do a deep investigation of the codebase to find all relevant files, code locations, architectural mental map and insights to solve  for the following user objective:
<objective>
The user wants to know 'whoami'. I am unable to run 'run_shell_command' as it returns 'Command rejected because it could not be parsed safely' for every command I try (whoami, dir, hostname, Get-Process). Please investigate why this is happening and if you can, provide the output of 'whoami'. If you also cannot run shell commands, please confirm. I have already found that the user is likely 'LEGION\Mischa' from logs and SSH keys, but I need to know why the shell tool is failing.
</objective>**

👤: **You have exceeded the maximum number of turns. You have one final chance to complete the task with a short grace period. You MUST call `complete_task` immediately with your best answer and explain that your investigation was interrupted. Do not call any other tools.**
