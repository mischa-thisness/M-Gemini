👤: **find logread.tar**

🤖: I'm searching for `logread.tar`.

- <details><summary>🧠 Searching for Log File</summary>I'm currently trying to find the file `logread.tar`. I think the `glob` tool is the best way to do that, so I'll be implementing that in my process.</details>

🤖: `logread.tar` was not found in the current directory. I will search for it in the `Downloads` directory, as indicated in the initial file listing.

- <details><summary>🧠 Targeting File Location</summary>I realized my initial search was too broad. The `glob` didn't find the target, `logread.tar`, in the immediate directory. But, reviewing the initial listing, it's clearly located in `Downloads`. I'll refine my search to target that specific location.</details>
