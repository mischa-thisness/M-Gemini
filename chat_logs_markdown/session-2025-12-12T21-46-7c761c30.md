- **Searching for Log File**: I'm currently trying to find the file `logread.tar`. I think the `glob` tool is the best way to do that, so I'll be implementing that in my process.

**Tool Call:** `glob`
```json
{
  "pattern": "logread.tar"
}
```
> No files found

- **Targeting File Location**: I realized my initial search was too broad. The `glob` didn't find the target, `logread.tar`, in the immediate directory. But, reviewing the initial listing, it's clearly located in `Downloads`. I'll refine my search to target that specific location.

**Tool Call:** `glob`
```json
{
  "pattern": "logread.tar",
  "dir_path": "C:\\Users\\Mischa\\Downloads"
}
```
> Found 1 matching file(s)

**Gemini:** `logread.tar` was not found in the current directory. I will search for it in the `Downloads` directory, as indicated in the initial file listing.


**Gemini:** I found `logread.tar` at `C:\Users\Mischa\Downloads\logread.tar`.


**You:** find logread.tar

**You:** hi

**Tool Call:** `glob`

**Gemini:** I'm searching for `logread.tar` again.


**Gemini:** I already found `logread.tar` in `C:\Users\Mischa\Downloads\logread.tar`. Did you want me to do something else with it?
