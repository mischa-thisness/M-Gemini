My goal is to determine the correct extension ID (likely in the form `publisher.extension-name`) for \"Auto Accept Agent\" by searching Open VSX or VS Code Marketplace. Then, I plan to attempt installation using a command like `antigravity --install-extension <extension-id>`.",

These include:\n-   **Private Keys** (SSH/GPG)\n-   **API Keys** (Generic, GCP)\n-   **1Password Secret Keys**\n\nThese are primarily located in your chat logs (`FULL_CHAT_LOG.md`, `chat_logs_markdown/*.md`, `transcripts/*.md`) and raw data files. Since this is an archive of our conversations, these might be expected if you pasted keys into our chats, but they are now permanently in your git history.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nIf these keys are active, **you must rotate them immediately**. The pre-commit hook will prevent *new* secrets from being added, but it does not fix the existing history. To clean the history, you would need to rewrite it (e.g., using `git filter-repo`), but that is a destructive operation.\n\nFor now, Gitleaks is active and will protect future commits.",

      "content": "Rewriting Git history is a powerful but destructive process used to permanently remove data (like secrets or large files) from a repository's past.\n\nHere is what \"rewriting history\" actually entails:\n\n### What it does\n1.  **Traverses Time:** Tools like `git filter-repo` or `BFG Repo-Cleaner` go through every single commit in your project's entire history, from the very first one to the most recent.\n2.  **Modifies Commits:** For every commit where a specific file (e.g., `secret.txt`) or text string (e.g., a specific API key) existed, the tool modifies that commit to remove it.\n3.  **Calculates New Hashes:** Because a Git commit ID (SHA) is a cryptographic hash of its contents *and* its parent's hash, changing a commit in the past changes its ID. This change ripples forward.\n    *   If you change Commit A (from 2024), Commit B (which points to A) must also change to point to the *new* A.\n    *   This causes a chain reaction that changes the Commit ID of **every single commit** that came after the modification.\n\n### What is \"Destroyed\"?\n*   **Original Commit IDs:** The old history is effectively orphaned. All your old commit hashes (e.g., `bc55e88`) will be replaced by new ones. Links to specific commits in issue trackers or documentation will break.\n*   **Signatures:** If you signed your previous commits with GPG (like we just set up), those signatures become invalid and are lost because the content they signed has changed. You would need to resign the new commits.\n*   **Collaborator Sync:** This is the most disruptive part. If anyone else has cloned this repository, their history will no longer match the remote history.\n    *   They will see \"diverged\" history.\n    *   If they try to `git pull`, it will likely cause massive conflicts.\n    *   They typically have to delete their local copy and re-clone the repo fresh.\n\n### Why do it?\nIt is the **only** way to truly remove a secret from Git. Simply adding a new commit that deletes the file (`git rm secret.key`) only removes it from the *current* version of the code. The secret still exists in the history, and anyone can retrieve it by checking out an older commit.\n\n### Summary\n*   **Safe for:** Solo projects or teams that can coordinate a \"stop work\" period to all re-clone the repo.\n*   **Dangerous for:** Active public repositories with many forks or contributors you don't know, as you will break their workflow.\n\nSince `M-Gemini` appears to be a personal archive, rewriting history is a viable option if you want to scrub those keys. Would you like to proceed with that?",

We need to replace the secret text *within* the files across all history.\n4.  **Verify:** Run Gitleaks again to confirm the history is clean.\n5.  **Force Push:** (Optional/Final Step) You will need to force push (`git push --force`) the changes to GitHub to update the remote repository.\n\nI'll start by checking if `git-filter-repo` is available.",

Since I cannot \"cd\" in the agent state, I will execute commands pointing to that directory.\n\nI will attempt to use `git filter-branch` to remove the sensitive files `FULL_CHAT_LOG.md` and `FULL_TRANSCRIPT.md` from the history entirely, as scrubbing them line-by-line with standard tools is complex and prone to errors without `git-filter-repo`. **Is removing these two large log files from history acceptable?** They seem to contain the bulk of the leaks.\n\nFor the other smaller files in `chat_logs_markdown`, I can try to scrub them.\n\nLet's try to verify `git` access again by checking the status of that repo.",
