                  "output": "Web search results for \"Intel XTU CLI alternative for Core Ultra command line overclocking\":\n\nIntel Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU) version 10.0 and newer officially supports overclocking for unlocked Intel Core Ultra Processors (Series 2), such as the Core Ultra 9 285HX, Core Ultra 7 265HX, and Core Ultra 5 245K/KF. This functionality requires an unlocked K or X series processor and a compatible Z-chipset motherboard (e.g., Z890). Additionally, BIOS enablement and the Intel Platform Innovation Framework (IPF) are necessary, with IPF typically enabled by default in the latest BIOS revisions.[1][2][3][4][5][6]\n\nWhile Intel XTU is primarily a Windows-based graphical utility, if you are seeking a command-line interface (CLI) alternative for Core Ultra overclocking, options are more limited and often depend on the operating system and specific hardware.\n\nFor third-party alternatives that might offer command-line control, you could investigate the **Universal x86 Tuning Utility**. This tool is designed to unlock the potential of Intel/AMD devices, but you would need to verify its specific CLI capabilities and compatibility with Core Ultra processors.[7]\n\nIt's important to note that direct overclocking and undervolting settings are also accessible through your motherboard's BIOS/UEFI. While not a command-line interface within the operating system, the BIOS provides fundamental control over processor core and graphics frequencies, voltages, and memory timings.[8][9][10][11][12]\n\nFor Linux users, tools like `intel-undervolt` exist for older Intel CPUs to manage undervolting, power, and temperature limits via the command line. However, it is explicitly stated as not compatible with Tiger Lake and newer architectures, which would include Core Ultra processors.[13]\n\nAlways exercise caution when overclocking, as altering clock frequency or voltage can potentially damage components, reduce stability, and may void product warranties.[10][14]\n\nSources:\n[1] intel.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGkcI4sa7P3sripNEMTvSC28obE8AWA76hLYz6PnGtEURaHcuKPCjghnARcdnC2qNs3WK579Uqy7PsromfYaQTdSALnHZB-eSeicVhOQqiTBpuDxhuL8IUcPltrjgG3CHt6mmH0xq5NbjzKdtEtdlaB0cC3EYzEzVaYT0yGHpsTcH-7-XSTvUvrLew68nXRRVXMI9RV6fcg0lJDIvAZ)\n[2] intel.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGVRb38tbjSlTKz3X71R-zDstnG5H42tFtBbA5hTo9_ZG2qFHDRkvb4stZCQNLhCWkIpilLeMBhwTuHk7uUQEMOdRtGqtQfkQhmtal9C-KGrTcb6ki7sL4-UWUSKCXD0fgANKSQJ4JjkZrYgu7GFQKDsMEgyVqZYImor8CMuHCP3xG9ejV3rEq_0AIsnQncAjYWJyWezMtbhwP0iq1mUIdJVnbOdWMcpEeEN6Ip99M=)\n[3] intel.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHIvi4uPNSeF9ldF3L1-ZU2lcd_1WdYtwqzS7RWUvywNQ7V9cC8TB3nmSXCvWqGh77F5HTD8vOzudMlWScIp-g2FV-cYU7IYJuoKOxafnZalg9plSzodaImNy6QknGF_RWWRf3agDJI6ZIv_mHh_KSGlQbQgLnamtAp2c5vMNIPvqIQMy7nBEF1Jdl5p9mpnMhBQyF65HIvH_4HLpbOeCzuWaEE)\n[4] softpedia.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEsF73ffExJLwSx7lrAk2V0jGr3Ti8GfyRuGANLPMqWxzU6Fi9-g0yYubvUARo7dKPGjV0Y1gP7uJitN567Y03ANuzmyGFDK9CCZOyGZymMpBm8JbJgY9uk5-DKjzqK85vadmCkGDMrXwDq6_47S_yrM9GghXt4H0uTtEZzPH2A_oqSEQ6s9W9-X-yFCluClaSD0d03o6iFZIzQDRs2orR-bo2Mo42cTBLEqf6I02MX3Aok)\n[5] reddit.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE0BiG54DJWR2FhOQ2Mdqi3CouG3wH88yFXpOJX9whbiCYMuoik0PeB4RBWtVqZJvlcmnZzUQcAOA5FoPH1W8qbr02FuY1zsJD9P0aVgi6baGEFFWgGnIlyCp9hkBzMtQgAdjsFGkpzIFtmbf84JJp3PO3-_7_JIAEU5KUqelyaqkSJQDgAb0wRSHfBeUY42M-syY5N1w==)\n[6] xda-developers.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE8-xBJPP7B_AC1DLm4WvbH-iWUSgc2BsU_lu5btvFo22UCGYUqkw7ukYw7y5Md6R0IW1De0eOSGHXATFk2-DwEBOtQi4UUbbwPuuHbZwBACSiuUfR4TwloSfXpetKMX6L2W7gn1hAtGi6pTZGhDDMcN7KMV9HW-cg4je1nzkVcVil7KhTF-stDX_E=)\n[7] sourceforge.net (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE421cMi2ZyT3OhZvBLbqiwO2nY9N2kQ16K9OqG6eJOvX8DmY_8_DCnrH8HFquXQZPGKT10VghRMwHxSxnKbJmc1icUfs4SR6581YlhlgZQtjM2c1fO92gHtftiPF_bSENMzZTpLhsQe1L5)\n[8] youtube.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGKjtnmlXyAhqy5kKpZKfcCe-Qqu6yDTGa3GC9kUzF2xkf5ViH717GoJWEqHRRS6MjmDuR71QR1wNOtKtY1LgsvmNRewKaSi2XMfotl1F86B1Boe1PA6pQV-O4z_KnXb5Qpf52aJLU=)\n[9] youtube.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHBWS5do9ttgzmGg8VlCMHX4sK2OU55SBkDx-FWMct8gJ5InOR8-aFdKz9gY0G_5WFr6ZwYI-bVqVP60HgR4dC0ag6D_si1tFtTZ4z0wQw5ntZV5nxeSit3BSVu341ZmEzpdPCgM04=)\n[10] intel.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF3YZKEOAnNix8seSG3ktcHnZaaPtPtBhKTJt6FtfW5Atu9X6POdaol4dd4DeqFOKubMvn2cJhTC6qpm0FgoSk7TQQSxll-sKnttrldzsxcslS7SFNKsDVOxqS4HI8i-VV9nIcUsrYRiTYbaf2Opk4EC7iwOD9MR71IzYzyUS8PRb9Jl4tILW-gRqfcUbkZAA==)\n[11] youtube.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEQI8aLl2eGyn7KwWSFN2DKI2F2UREQTWkZfssRIj4KJ6pRiiGSBGVyt3zYPmW-6yDnjkMd6XtpdI6luvl1M_n54SBoagn9H_EKT_W5HObEhNZRnLo_DlVywqZTMxGIQ8QrVbC_vVE=)\n[12] youtube.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGe7_CgjlRRGHYqPNI8S17WVXB3Iz4BkNci9wH0OGtBG8ZMcWEqFYBHui0QyjGVvjIwzcEvkxwcDBktNiAwQd24cCvR1UyAntut43OK7A7WK3CD3TtbG0K8gD0udK6fquYgacvr35A=)\n[13] archlinux.org (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFh17pRVF79g7sC22jkcHEGixFP0dalDNa-fiPA4flep9KbFLoeWB0mmUqFfTi5NuLDvHweinDN38KG10yHQEMd8JeB7-qnf85n07qz15UEyK3jtCdIwLd-bwvJc4EbVjRKo5rYH_rH9K-VU74=)\n[14] intel.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEnLKjLzxshgsMDHklaEIaqoVtLoy41kz_7BtabVrArFw-AaAFmuKroa7o_35YYhuVxUc-U-KkGi-i2sQyQCX9c8T0EmxFBxRqBRHJtWYZ4EiN4TWaq9AdAUiqHrzdiC8xa8RYAWglsApgSF6QFMeknh_lXyf7nfnOp7lmdrYzaJb7k7qZVA66y8ZbbiRaDMW1j6GvKvtcY1mtDDnUzQevLXM8=)"

                  "output": "Web search results for \"Universal x86 Tuning Utility CLI command line ThrottleStop CLI IntelOverclockingSDK.dll PowerShell Lenovo Legion WMI overclocking\":\n\nHere's a breakdown of command-line and PowerShell capabilities for x86 tuning, including ThrottleStop, IntelOverclockingSDK.dll, PowerShell with Lenovo Legion WMI, and Universal x86 Tuning Utility:\n\n### ThrottleStop CLI\n\nThrottleStop is a utility designed to monitor and correct CPU throttling, allowing users to fine-tune performance settings such as voltage, clock speed, and power limits.[1][2] While ThrottleStop primarily operates through a graphical user interface, there have been discussions and user attempts to control it via command-line or scripting.\n\n*   **Profile Switching:** Users have explored methods to switch ThrottleStop profiles using external scripts (e.g., VBScript executed via `wscript.exe` and batch files) based on system conditions like CPU load or temperature. However, this approach might not offer the granular overclocking control available directly within the ThrottleStop GUI.[3]\n*   **Autostart and Persistence:** ThrottleStop settings are temporary and reset upon reboot unless the application is configured to launch automatically at startup.[4] The application saves its settings and reloads them when launched.[4]\n*   **INI Options:** Recent versions (e.g., 9.7.3) include an `ExitTime=1` INI option, which forces ThrottleStop to exit one second after starting, suggesting some level of programmatic control over its execution lifecycle.[5]\n\n### IntelOverclockingSDK.dll PowerShell\n\nThe `IntelOverclockingSDK.dll` is a component of the Intel Overclocking SDK, intended for developers to programmatically control CPU frequency ratios.[6]\n\n*   **Programmatic Access:** To utilize this DLL, developers must download and install the SDK, then reference the library in their projects (e.g., C# applications) and interact with its API. The API documentation is found within the SDK's installation directory.[6]\n*   **No Direct CLI:** The SDK is not a direct command-line utility. Interacting with it via PowerShell would typically require developing a custom PowerShell module or script that uses P/Invoke (Platform Invoke) to call functions from the unmanaged DLL, which is a complex development task.\n*   **Intel XTU Integration:** For Lenovo Legion laptops with Intel CPUs, installing Intel Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU) is sometimes necessary to enable CPU overclocking options within the Lenovo Vantage software.[7] Intel XTU itself offers features like \"AI overclocking\" for newer CPUs, which automatically applies optimal settings.[8]\n*   **Risks:** Overclocking using such tools carries risks, including potential hardware damage and voiding warranties.[6]\n\n### Lenovo Legion WMI Overclocking PowerShell\n\nLenovo Legion laptops utilize Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for various system controls, including switching between power modes (quiet, balanced, performance).[9]\n\n*   **WMI for System Settings:** PowerShell can interact with Lenovo BIOS settings through WMI classes like `Lenovo_BiosSetting` and `Lenovo_SetBiosSetting` in the `root\\wmi` namespace. This allows for querying and potentially modifying certain BIOS parameters.[10]\n*   **Limited Overclocking via WMI:** While WMI is used for power profiles, direct, granular CPU or GPU overclocking parameters might not be fully exposed or easily controllable through generic WMI commands. A GitHub project attempting to control GPU power limits on Lenovo Legion via WMI noted that replicating the full behavior of Lenovo Vantage was challenging.[9]\n*   **BIOS Prerequisite:** For CPU overclocking options to appear in Lenovo Vantage, it's often necessary to first enable overclocking in the system's BIOS.[11]\n\n### Universal x86 Tuning Utility CLI\n\nThe Universal x86 Tuning Utility (UXTU) is a powerful tool for optimizing x86 laptops and computers, providing fine-grained control over processor and GPU settings like clock speeds, power limits, and voltages.[12][13] It is considered a lightweight alternative to tools like Ryzen Master and Intel XTU.[12][13]\n\n*   **GUI-Focused:** UXTU primarily operates as a graphical application. The available information and demonstrations (e.g., YouTube videos) showcase a GUI for adjusting settings such as temperature limits, power limits, and various CPU/GPU parameters.[14][15]\n*   **No Explicit CLI:** There is no explicit mention or documentation of a command-line interface for UXTU in the search results. Its design appears to be centered around its user-friendly graphical interface for tuning.\n\nSources:\n[1] throttlestop.net (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGQb_n9_1CuJxq4ThYcKa6fewaKlBwsJUCexfCaXjQEtLgCA5697I2iSzLkZ_D-9NzIFFkKw2twE0WFMt1oHpFDoCenPVgDDuB3O-fFszO69zjZEyU=)\n[2] ultrabookreview.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEZsLpQSkTGPaN9dnXPY61lJz4zfWgqLEN8tNa1jJFC_Es9cqqoC6EkhsnFY593DeaqD0O1tP5X8gl9SadxGFqqrMaMX2mF489NUVoXEF8_eiWthmnsa1ZvpB-UbfanoJy37yeiZYsu6fIKmuM3jXTzVe0YPgO2azQ=)\n[3] techpowerup.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHzAzZvNiaRHvVl8yve8X5lBOqCwQ2CMWdHAm1uFewfH7T0YFt_PokmfunKLjxshxz_QRXRM0687k68LnOswOEUA0tDBgDBRGp-6pWQJUqCphJacbKNEUitA0HXvrhlyoOD-vN-VBoudHZEk5FxVOZsXgCBbQeir8CJA6mZJwTIKy3QxmBjLAFG_UpnCBQvY9h6pA4Vl1nLBBbG08CsHAQ3mptPMNs=)\n[4] reddit.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFz3EYwuzdBNrR0Xtd_lvPmEA_Kn2txRo3Ps5asGoD3i7pUXcRQZBRK8vz5jcEFhoEoyxV9-f6_VHIAiEyYnBzy4kpndmZC50GQQKK59WizqbIr6T-d1KAOpH2gBBR6ff8QQxD69tX9YuP_VxqUYmD0-9J5e5wSeKIew_bL69g_6fXRZLqtwBEAR6rv2PmPJOT49OgayiAE_UjYIQ-8Dg==)\n[5] techpowerup.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE0b3uHAEcdiblsryuC0s5X89VvtF_Y9Z_7MWTk1F0z840vUyGHr2uz4OfJBnANTQHmJ4dM0yI276142fTqGSWH7bHMuMORO7lCSAoa0OQacLODdENgGuAeY4YgEbu8F8oPljFTfwWP7zFEu9fkDAJQ-VouE-AzZSeN)\n[6] intel.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHG1dgQyYhx-DuGMQY9fO2QIIl_yRxuq00LDYNsPQNUwg7f0OZBgC-O_ZMll1xJjcPvFNaoIckgdFsFtKHSPU7n1HGP_DyZz_aD494cT1C5z5xb2aKV9ICXpJhu_EkqKXvKK5HG6oAI1gdk7dlhblO1Kq1wl5tlFzAmPOW9hr4T_y-s5okqomAuvVPzhLpH6F51HUPTSYPXIBEXPgjQTg==)\n[7] reddit.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEp14I_vxJ_S6tIjGGT1OoUC1VMGzTQ5TGt3ylUO8-ndhc9ViI1S23sO_X5Cj53n4iMwzek8kBEbz2QN8OVWGhpBpv55wcBerW3-a2I_WD4ZJHqVlo6Apf5rUUz3LFUeO1FEVzbb5iJo8WzSXjAkefEmrx930_dY9HBpQY8qeBd4TjCcBBi91I9ByX_Kwu1zx7_Lp7hsSmj0TNNTi7eFtbl)\n[8] youtube.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG2uxd3l0nxjyVnD7-ynBWt0Zf7hecMuCqU-zEDVAv4nqZmz28qavAysdX6C_ZbaoWbP2B2WQOTuui4PQmYxbyJPLDvNx5WtOxA1jzrwrtIVJk8tSlOE0ibOfmV4Wj2ZNZU62jFc1Q=)\n[9] github.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEe4oLs_8jTj1pUFty76Y8011TmFfez4E0bYNU-75YXq_gOmSWKg122PAXCiJbqvvlQmhPB6HaGZfD8gnYJwmC6ZN3z_MDqFegfAfi19uDKvyT9aXFMmgyCnJcOijfEXtN2)\n[10] reddit.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEzToPIXkxGx1vDdTSwNuJOPbuh37ctt5Quka11U9qmjW1zapEB7aiEjW6YeyWlb9HB3XnX4ZRJjR1b2ZEsn9Xr98_t45Jpf1a2AOki-gQEosiLslw-opVNav1tIUHfsINcxCZzTSeC_DJLSlgeX5Vuvqy3JDbrz_5foSU312lxoHpJyJ5myLmBxHRBE4iZjbIGtlQ=)\n[11] reddit.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEwDuAXlUBVy-WJ7RvBcIn_vuvBKG_7KUtgtmJ3VlJDREwnMXhh14r1fxMINs7yLwoz_LtUUWDx_uJHINHYHm_xu_zoYpI60at9oDyyMVw9AyirX3lwQ5qcg8D-uhV3sr7doCJRymf5AQl0HPqP_b8-HotY8e61dwa4lbWKaQBuH0qw6jFqkAt9eGTsSPSxIh6UEZ00Zq68OpUkfzL6uzH9gB0v)\n[12] amdaputuningutility.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF0AvdOZQtSXpgrw0l17S-WdE9xaGTxTolPlHO1WPAr3wSwrKD2UYML1O_zFXLh5KSGYRVqsErGf7oQozVcVcLJWieVCPa7A39S3_ZL_MVRQ-qrsltEAi0aB9ym)\n[13] github.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEjn0pwfNmM5rUKFyME73o2ZNtEL0o5Ch8L6XPPa4Z431mBma4GTbTlgrKXy7gJaZw-v5-76AZMcAoDqg8sZ5_ErONEPjjR2ihR7ZMzZ3dDnltJZJFrl7ycckLOt4JVx4TeZik4ljbCdG6itD2rpPr-h-fzcQ==)\n[14] youtube.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEHr2W-bdVnnFynwEDh3CiqqENT5TCN49a8mD2w1QZY_GXU_3osYQf5nBWFB_79YSYn0HV7SP1-cnPuXFiOKOpDmE79LglPFSnSdtO3CeYFTVHILWH5hKcZQ6zw857jtioZtS2XWGk=)\n[15] youtube.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEtP7xZ4bpvAz8B0F7eFczkPbOGoyXmz1kJiymV1maWQLCLokc5gXpHogQvIs-YFNwSQQpd4WeZWLDWX8SKfiS6AID-8qzqsWiEN79ZoRFvnlas7X2PX0vYoVA2LW4Ta6Z8kUU8lpY=)"

However, direct WMI classes or properties specifically named `LENOVO_CPU_OVERCLOCKING_DATA`, `TuneID`, `Core Voltage Offset`, or `Performance Core Ratio` are not explicitly detailed in the general Lenovo WMI deployment guides[1][2][3][4][5][6].\n\nWhile \"Core Voltage Offset\" and \"Performance Core Ratio\" are standard terms used in CPU overclocking and undervolting[7][8][9][10], their availability and exact naming within Lenovo's WMI interface would depend on the specific Lenovo model and its BIOS version. If these settings are exposed via WMI, they would typically be accessible as string-based values through generic BIOS setting classes, such as `Lenovo_BiosSetting` in the `root\\wmi` namespace[1][3].\n\nUsers often manage CPU overclocking and undervolting on Lenovo systems through the BIOS directly or by using third-party tools like Intel Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU) or ThrottleStop[7][8][9][11][12][13][14][10]. Some Lenovo Legion models offer overclocking options within their BIOS, and recent BIOS updates have sometimes impacted undervolting capabilities[11][13][15][16].\n\nTo identify the precise WMI setting names for CPU overclocking parameters on a particular Lenovo system, one would typically need to:\n1.  Examine the system's BIOS settings to note the exact names of any relevant overclocking options.\n2.  Use a WMI query tool, such as PowerShell's `Get-WmiObject -Namespace root\\wmi -Class Lenovo_BiosSetting`, to list all available BIOS settings and then filter for keywords related to CPU performance or overclocking.[1][3]\n\nSources:\n[1] scribd.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHEhYf1acMwWuKRivYDYGnRHVXrMKLxNDnMFbGZofsP61URyn62LSpZGLE7Ul9YYQPIhZpfiu6EYxQ2HLafDUHqBKVCLTnahT05DH8Qh48oNpqD6aFFHm2fUt7tLeH3ZKdVIqE7bLONP98cb5GR_u6jgiD99fVL5dOhkvayZ8oz1RdRjop1iFrEiBydICjqY3pr1JOu3E1Qlzw6VzTefE3xQ3ATQ2lIwQzlSqx9D5-5wJIMQ-s=)\n[2] mediasupport.org (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEtSXKJSe2r-xksUVM3rpFbqRrHqM1WyuKwf-UdbqSnQjLAbW15F08jv2_kVkTswTspm3f4DOrg8JM2uaxAzK7Bmfl1VShtRgKeBeQhnr5xg-CWluzCJFoGJssP08Yy0w9G4tAX9zmX_EmfJvxXWnHMrie5lhyciPQFTZVOks09XeVik-A=)\n[3] configjon.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHJR5kwKCI6mgv1p7TrV_hJSkrU6m7VpNC_BAo3a6AJHKU2ZAojbY2bpZg43Zx8fh4kbKOBTZ1uuHgkgQ-HCkkzT53AHyE_25LHTJm8rMpNsHQSPt8_3hM0VJ4DPQRyJmBnqVviHntSxH2kttlp-4tpjk5khlo=)\n[4] lenovo.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG5-hVw4-a7IbDriKElHazBP2-KOEzVgxbY0j2eToX2jraUv6uG28n-MQezEFaXhsaKRKnA5qeSo3KwCoBIcbL8vJ9P_MgCiKPCi-4FHuDBTiOk2mIEKuSzsdi23feXGaq8JVu-YzC2ds4xk4QLHGO0kBPt_qTkgTejUAgk0s3c1dtcO_7zy3xsKQ10)\n[5] lenovo.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGbA6wxsvoASZGOqRIv62S76mQQJ0b_vr3tJkkFtSmgrzM6O1qEU2xosmmFJUszOuk9c5HIg3e9nYkq0Gj83fbHwTOBvb1UXIOlU1bc91FS0dRx98jmS70L0fNKTYez9eQKFoD6UU-5lvtJOnXLPq4PIkd2QnfPqChbvOp_gVpw4kHusttzJazQdaXUIUlt-wTyfVw8TIPdk2r9UuJx-JRaH8VwkpB59XWWgKdvtiBhCLf7sOUb9zwvJT6-5usoi9TKyQ-p)\n[6] lenovo.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEOXUyuvoX5XPj9njLczMm55cxw4zQGL3S9LSibhlItz3cSMj8MwM3JHpzTmz9L37XEXefvPlpNLPT08Mp07ZVc9s7U7dHr9owq-ZNTGCHu-OdyIMwUUgjl_VkmVhpp6W9WJIUhthxrg5oMchG0wmoNbcvywE56ezPuSUD6pg==)\n[7] lenovo.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE2AjR_3W4ZTCd0MJWsfoNAPyOSeGXWmLJR7usdGvofNinHlIfReJop2eDfW0wYrTs4sDdrpq_LipMb9MZTN-F8ooTZnuUVXZGFT2-uKRQR_0LUuSJ5TmmZc8FPZoDkuYyFxz9JcrJUlKNji9csr47L0Djc_xC5HjAOj2eZ0-sDQlg=)\n[8] youtube.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGijtyPBgoSY35CBvwbHmEhnefLm8AjmemC273mHep2XQlIVykDN__hbhqGmasGjg6Q7gssNAHQg5mg-r2FtekAVvwxojFHQI0_eLyccahz1jENMMnF5Nx5UR3vu9eWyyl57itt7Cw=)\n[9] youtube.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGT_rxdQc2hH54rH5Js6t0HWpWieIo0XZ8W_wK9KhKflybvJFFWO_JyKfoBdchDorPbOh-EN_oYareN5Lp78Uq53rzHKS2ADxMnqOAUTUZ2pQmu7UbE_2GuUQcqCr7OGvOABRQQ0_w=)\n[10] youtube.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEzYXmTiiQy6V5HaDKHiIVlOXvqA1PG1Bmawgc-BfLLwVDcevQgU1dFJiWv_M6WUCHIt6lLA5eUsPh6FV7DgJ4CnMGwgI-ImIinHlVNK7xWapreIoM5eEQE9tNFHOWDd9e3DHEjlKE=)\n[11] superuser.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQES0tPo0FJrXoT65j7YQ4QiRv8n5lcp_wIDzC8hWzbmEs1062hCPYo1LObogicQBFnag2wIewVEOirHoowtkb52703-9hwaPVDcq3VigHtK0eQvMKJiLnD1KAsO4DFYlccSLaVRf5KWj6heO5v3yXjssfUUV5uB3Fm_I14iMaP6kZuhVvoKhpdb7oAvtAB4afF5xVLq48CkqUrZ)\n[12] youtube.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG1d8bor8q5Q63LGnaIwfWTz30Tn80Q_Nf_yGR_w9EN87BFvStr732JaLU9vG68cXFBV8zjP-chaS84dxfaMiHOYwRLnp39TJo5xuXXlXTA7QyNsIbcyCrlQqoD1D5VZ0guxJIwH9c=)\n[13] reddit.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHVqrAEvNGJVCrRdDsph93CPveZUlayj3FXmTyJYj5TZ3ixFmYWnzdVs5uYYnswQPbFtv7Yp08EXe8TJxiZV_EmyHRRc6KaIaGwbb6Ley2rZHTNYdd1PL0ZlvIt4bNEXBVJOBAqIk2K-HAY2-ww9DyKmV7otYBcY-w2gc0iMw3ENR0kslS_xrNKOzehqJ0Hnsok_Vw6GRzd8YxKus1ygrVo)\n[14] youtube.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHW_--C5apzmJS3WEamoSg-YwmvbcW3md4JCdi3ETEr_rUzEemfIJUCl0ZzrngBpvUw1IKrAS_37JLK6NSDXMZU61-57Kf38pfooXH8huG5ue9CsHJeqwOHGYRz5h7AeP8fHBxilFQ=)\n[15] youtube.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF6rwD3nWC4ePS6SQiLIPrTDckoBPlpOTzgcyYVQFhx0dg-Njfs2QHKsEaivFAhCDEXblQzLY_g_pvJxRtlNO6sgsAz_lb0NvMqW82amIJHbpA8pG3bWdghgA4i_TYaCTu5W0rUjA==)\n[16] reddit.com (https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEKxVJ9IFnTtggM2_Bl_0ISbzgmCbi0ZiIg0JEZk7KkES3Dug9dvUmAiH2gQUBY-49KZ_7ozL6AWqYCaIQGw-TQLcrZwjJRAjo9YU-8acdKH8keyiC3iZjOBHCBrxdupt5R7raJeXFieEekEpJfvk-xQiuh0r3asHlLFixj6Z2s3o4r02PWNHLFo1U-mPK98nTe2C_AjyRsBGF4hMEGEg==)"

      "content": "The search results confirm that there is no public documentation for the mapping of `TuneID` to specific settings like \"Core Voltage Offset\" in the `LENOVO_CPU_OVERCLOCKING_DATA` class. However, we have access to the `LENOVO_CPU_OVERCLOCKING_DATA` instances on your system, which contain valid data (TuneIDs, Min/Max/Current values).\n\nThe next logical step is to attempt to \"reverse engineer\" the `TuneID` mapping by correlating the current values in WMI with the actual system values.\n\nTo do this, I need to know the *current* Core Voltage Offset and Performance Core Ratio of your CPU. Since we don't have a dedicated CLI tool for this, I will use `throttlestop` if I can find a way to run it or query its config, or more reliably, use the `systeminfo` or standard Windows counters (though they might not show offsets).\n\nWait, the best way to identify the `TuneID` is to look at the `DefaultValue`, `MinValue`, `MaxValue`, and `ScaleValue` properties we retrieved.\n\nLet's analyze the data we got:\n*   Most items have a `ScaleValue` of `1065353216`.\n*   We have `TuneID`s: 29, 30, 31, 32, 42, 43, 96, 97, 4500-4515, 34, 114, 79, 76.\n*   The `DefaultValue` and `OCValue` are large integers (e.g., `1113063424`). These are likely raw integer representations of floating-point numbers or fixed-point values.\n*   `1065353216` in hex is `0x3F800000`, which is the IEEE 754 floating-point representation of `1.0`. This suggests the values are scaled floats.\n\nLet's convert `1113063424` to a float to see if it makes sense.\n`1113063424` (decimal) -> `0x42580000` (hex).\n`0x42580000` as a float is `54.0`.\n\nLet's check `1112539136`.\n`1112539136` -> `0x42500000` -> `52.0`.\n\nThese look like Multipliers (Ratios)!\n*   `TuneID 29` & `30`: Value `54.0`. (54x Multiplier?)\n*   `TuneID 31`, `32`, `42`, `43`, `96`, `97`: Value `52.0`. (52x Multiplier?)\n*   `TuneID 4500-4515`: Value `36.0` (Calculated: `1110966272` -> `0x42380000` -> `46.0`? No, let's re-calculate).\n    *   `1110966272` -> `0x42380000`.\n    *   `0x42380000` as float is `46.0`.\n\nThis strongly suggests:\n*   `TuneID 29` (Value 54) could be **Performance Core Ratio** (1-Core Turbo?).\n*   `TuneID 30` (Value 54) could be another Turbo ratio.\n*   `TuneID 31-97` (Value 52) could be All-Core Turbo or similar.\n*   `TuneID 4500+` (Value 46) could be Efficiency Core Ratios.\n\nNow let's look for Voltage Offsets. Voltage offsets are usually small values like -0.050 or 0.\nWe have some entries with `DefaultValue: 0`:\n*   `TuneID 34`: Value 0. Min: `3253731328` (`0xC1F00000` -> `-30.0`? No, `C1F00000` is `-30.0`). Max: `1124859904` (`0x430C0000` -> `140.0`?). This range (-30 to 140) looks like millivolts or similar?\n    *   If `ScaleValue` is 1.0, then raw values are used.\n    *   Let's re-examine `0xC1F00000`. IEEE 754 float: `-30.0`.\n    *   Let's re-examine `0x430C0000`. IEEE 754 float: `140.0`.\n    *   Current Value: 0.\n    *   This could be **Core Voltage Offset** in millivolts (mV). A range of -30mV to +140mV is plausible, though -30 is small for an undervolt limit (usually go to -100 or more).\n\n*   `TuneID 79`: Value 0. Min `3253731328` (-30.0), Max `1126170624` (`0x43200000` -> `160.0`).\n*   `TuneID 114`: Value 0. Min 0. Max `1106771968` (`0x41F80000` -> `31.0`).\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n*   **Performance Core Ratio:** Likely `TuneID 29` (54x) or related.\n*   **Core Voltage Offset:** Likely `TuneID 34` or `79`.\n\nTo confirm, I'll calculate the float values for a few key IDs using PowerShell.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Use PowerShell to convert the integer values of `LENOVO_CPU_OVERCLOCKING_DATA` properties to Floats. This will make them human-readable.\n2.  Present the user with the \"decoded\" table and ask if they match their expected BIOS settings (e.g., \"Is your max turbo 54x?\").\n3.  If confirmed, I can offer to *set* these values using the `CPU_Set_OC_Data` method found in `LENOVO_CPU_METHOD`.\n\n**Caution:** Writing these values is risky. I must explicitly warn the user.\n\nLet's run the PowerShell script to decode the values.",

Set Core Voltage Offset**\nTo set a voltage offset (e.g., **-20 mV**), you must convert the float value to its integer representation and write it.\n\n**Example: Set TuneID 34 (Core Voltage) to -20 mV**\n```powershell\n# value = -20.0\n$bytes = [BitConverter]::GetBytes([single]-20.0)\n$intVal = [BitConverter]::ToUInt32($bytes, 0)\n# Method Args: mode (0), TuneID (34), Value\nInvoke-CimMethod -Namespace root/wmi -ClassName LENOVO_CPU_METHOD -MethodName CPU_Set_OC_Data -Arguments @{mode=0; TuneID=34; value=$intVal}\n```\n\n#### **2. Set Performance Core Ratio**\nTo set the max turbo ratio (e.g., set All-Core to **53x**).\n\n**Example: Set TuneID 31 (All-Core Turbo) to 53x**\n```powershell\n# value = 53.0\n$bytes = [BitConverter]::GetBytes([single]53.0)\n$intVal = [BitConverter]::ToUInt32($bytes, 0)\nInvoke-CimMethod -Namespace root/wmi -ClassName LENOVO_CPU_METHOD -MethodName CPU_Set_OC_Data -Arguments @{mode=0; TuneID=31; value=$intVal}\n```\n\n**Would you like me to create a simple PowerShell script utility for you to make these changes easier?** (e.g., `.\\Set-Cpu.ps1 -Offset -20`)",
